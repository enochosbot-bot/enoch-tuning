## BLOG POST QUEUE — Sourced from Existing Research

### Blog 1: "The Business Case for AI Agents: Why $400/yr Beats a $40k Salary Gap"
**Source:** `shared-context/agent-outputs/ridley-pricing-strategy.md` + x-launch-week Post 3 math
**Angle:** The 15–20 hrs/week recovery math. RIA context but broadly applicable. Conversion > savings framing.
**Target publish:** Week of Mar 9
**Notes:** High commercial value. Links naturally to `/blog/business-case-for-ai-agents.html` (already referenced in LinkedIn Batch 2).

---

### Blog 2: "AI Governance for Independent RIAs: What 'Figure It Out Responsibly' Actually Means"
**Source:** `shared-context/drafts/x-launch-week.md` (Post 2 thread angle) + `research/data-flow-audit_2026-02-26.md`
**Angle:** SEC's AI posture for RIAs — the enforcement gap, what a one-page AI policy looks like, why documented governance is the real risk management play.
**Target publish:** Week of Mar 16
**Notes:** Thought leadership. Niche but high-value for advisory audience. Mirrors Post 2 thread but at full depth.

---

### Blog 3: "Five Workflows That Save Time (And the One That Compounds It)"
**Source:** `research/social-drafts/queue/linkedin-batch2.md` (Post 2 + Post 4) + `research/social-drafts/queue/x-batch2-bootstrappers.md`
**Angle:** Not a listicle. A practical breakdown of the workflows — email, follow-up, scheduling, proposals, content — with the leverage frame as through-line.
**Target publish:** Week of Mar 23
**Notes:** Already referenced at `/blog/five-workflows-that-save-time.html` in LinkedIn Batch 2. Should exist before that post runs if possible.

---

### Blog 4: "Three AI Employees Running 24/7: What That Actually Looks Like"
**Source:** `research/openclaw_three_ai_employees_2026-02-15.md` + LinkedIn Batch 2 Post 3
**Angle:** The Ridley Research operating model — research agent, ops agent, content agent. Written as practitioner case study, not pitch.
**Target publish:** Week of Mar 30
**Notes:** Referenced at `/blog/three-ai-employees-running-247.html` in LinkedIn Batch 2. High authenticity potential. Deacon is the source — ghostwrite from his POV.

---

### Blog 5: "Agent-to-Agent Commerce: Why Your Business Needs an Endpoint Before Your Customers' Agents Come Looking"
**Source:** `research/social-drafts/queue/x-agent-commerce-thread.md` (expand thread to long-form)
**Angle:** Full version of the X thread. More depth on the SEO analogy, infrastructure framing, what "an agent endpoint" actually is.
**Target publish:** Week of Apr 6 (after thread ships and gets traction)
**Notes:** Hold until the X thread is approved and posted. Blog should drop 1–2 weeks after thread to capture search + extend the conversation.
