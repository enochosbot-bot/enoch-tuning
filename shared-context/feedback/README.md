# Feedback

Deacon's approvals and rejections. Every agent reads this.

When Deacon approves or rejects an agent output, Enoch logs it here as a weekly file:
`feedback-YYYY-WXX.md`

Format:
```
### [DATE] — [AGENT] — [APPROVED/REJECTED]
**What:** one-line summary of what was proposed
**Why:** Deacon's reasoning (if given)
**Lesson:** What all agents should learn from this
```

These compound. A rejection here teaches every agent, not just the one that got rejected.
