### 2026-02-14 — Arnold — APPROVED
**What:** HIGH finding — ngrok tunnel exposing port 3334 publicly. Recommended killing it.
**Why:** Deacon said "nuke ngrok." No hesitation.
**Lesson:** ngrok is not an acceptable exposure method. Kill tunnels by default unless explicitly needed. Tailscale is the replacement path.
