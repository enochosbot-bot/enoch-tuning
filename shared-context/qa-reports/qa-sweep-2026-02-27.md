# Basher QA Report — Nehemiah Sweep — 2026-02-27 16:00 CST

## Tasks Validated

### BL-004 | Ezra | X/Twitter Launch Posts → PASS → verified
- File: `shared-context/drafts/x-launch-week.md` ✅
- 5 posts confirmed present ✅
- All under 280 chars (219/230/243/258/237) ✅
- Policy-focused ✅
- Mix: 3 standalone + 2 thread-starters ✅
- No hashtags per brand voice ✅
- Sequencing table included ✅
- **VERDICT: PASS** — Status updated to `verified`.

---

### BL-005 | Bezzy | Social Post Pipeline Script → FAIL → reopened
- AC path: `scripts/social-post-pipeline.sh (or .py)` (shared workspace convention)
- Actual delivery path: `/Users/deaconsopenclaw/.openclaw/workspace-coder/scripts/`
- Both `.py` and `.sh` exist and are functional at the wrong location
- `social-post-pipeline.sh` and `social-post-pipeline.py` are NOT at `/Users/deaconsopenclaw/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/` where all system scripts live (vidgen.py, generate-health-dashboard.py, x-post.py, etc.)
- Impact: inaccessible to other agents via standard path; cron setup references workspace-coder, not shared workspace
- Fix required: move/copy both files to `/Users/deaconsopenclaw/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/` and update any cron path references accordingly
- **VERDICT: FAIL** — Status reopened to `open`. Bezzy notified.

### BL-010 | Gideon | System Health Dashboard → PASS → verified
- File: `shared-context/kpis/system-health.md` ✅
- Gateway uptime: PID 91784, runtime 02:13:42 ✅
- Session count: 32 ✅
- Disk usage: 4.0G ✅
- Cron success rate: 66.7% (12 pass / 6 fail) ✅
- Per-agent activity table present ✅
- Generator script: `scripts/generate-health-dashboard.py` — executable (-rwxr-xr-x), present ✅
- Minor note: "messages sent in last 24h" is proxied via session `updatedAt` (flagged in script as proxy metric — acceptable)
- **VERDICT: PASS** — Status updated to `verified`.

---

### BL-012 | Berean | FEC + Texas Ethics Tooling Spec → PASS → verified
- File: `shared-context/agent-outputs/fec-ethics-tooling-spec.md` ✅ (large, comprehensive)
- AC#1 — FEC bulk downloads + OpenFEC REST API: all 7 bulk files documented with direct URLs, sizes, formats, and priority; API endpoints, rate limits, and TX filter patterns documented ✅
- AC#2 — TEC data: CONTRIBS field schema, bulk CSV URLs, filing deadlines, data lag, no-API caveat, third-party alternatives (Transparency USA, FollowTheMoney) ✅
- AC#3 — Cross-reference approach: full 7-table SQLite schema, name normalization function, join confidence tiers, 4 concrete SQL investigation patterns (DFW zip map, Paxton network, bipartisan donors, lobbyist chain) ✅
- AC#4 — Open-source tools: OpenPlanter, python-fec, fec-loader, rapidfuzz, Transparency USA documented; build gaps (no tx-ethics-cli, no TEC wrapper, no FEC↔TEC cross-ref engine) explicitly called out ✅
- MVP implementation plan: 5–6 hour estimate, step-by-step, FEC key → pull → TEC → SQLite → dedup → first investigation ✅
- **VERDICT: PASS** — Status updated to `verified`. Ready for Deacon review → Bezzy build.

## Stale Task Check

No tasks are currently in `in-progress` status. No stale work to flag.

Active open tasks: BL-014 (Bezzy, RPG dashboard, on hold by design).

## Backlog Health (as of sweep)

| Status | Count | Task IDs |
|--------|-------|----------|
| verified | 12 | BL-001, BL-002, BL-003, BL-004, BL-006, BL-007, BL-008, BL-010, BL-012, BL-013, BL-015, BL-016, BL-017, BL-018, BL-019 |
| open | 2 | BL-005 (reopened), BL-014 (on hold) |
| blocked (prune-candidate) | 2 | BL-009, BL-011 |
| in-progress | 0 | — |

*Note: verified count includes tasks verified in prior sweeps.*

## Actions Taken This Sweep
1. BL-004 → `verified`
2. BL-005 → reopened to `open` + feedback sent to Bezzy (coder session)
3. BL-010 → `verified`
4. BL-012 → `verified`

---

## Recommended Follow-Up
- **Enoch/Mission Pulse:** BL-005 is unblocked but needs a path fix, not a rebuild. Lowest-effort re-dispatch possible — Bezzy just needs to `cp` or `mv` two files and update any cron path references.
- **Enoch:** BL-014 (RPG dashboard) hold condition is met — 6+ agents have meaningful output. Eligible for dispatch when bandwidth allows.
- **Enoch:** BL-009 and BL-011 remain prune-candidates. Recommend formal pruning if no reactivation by next sprint.
