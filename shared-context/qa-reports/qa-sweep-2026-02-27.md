## Tasks Validated

### BL-005 — Social Post Pipeline ✅ PASS
- **Owner:** Bezzy
- **Deliverable:** `scripts/social-post-pipeline.py` + `scripts/social-post-pipeline.sh`
- **Context:** Previously FAILED (2026-02-27 16:00 CST, Basher sweep) for wrong path. Bezzy fixed at 16:04 CST. Re-validated this sweep.
- **Path check:** Both files confirmed at `/Users/deaconsopenclaw/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/` ✅ (not workspace-coder)
- **AC validation:**
  - Reads from `shared-context/drafts/` ✅
  - Picks next unreviewed post (SHA1 dedup via `sent_ids` log) ✅
  - Sends Telegram approval message ✅
  - JSONL logging to `scripts/social-pipeline-log.jsonl` ✅
  - `--dry-run` supported ✅
  - Cron-ready: shell wrapper cron example references `workspace` (not `workspace-coder`) ✅
- **Verdict:** PASS → status updated to `verified` in backlog.md

---

### BL-014 — RPG Agent Dashboard ❌ FAIL
- **Owner:** Bezzy
- **Deliverable:** `scripts/dashboard/` (shared workspace)
- **Issue:** All 5 files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`, `data.js`, `refresh-data.mjs`) are in `/Users/deaconsopenclaw/.openclaw/workspace-coder/scripts/dashboard/` — Bezzy's private coder workspace. The shared workspace at `/Users/deaconsopenclaw/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/` has **no** `dashboard/` directory.
- **Content quality (positives):**
  - All 8 agents present in data.js: Enoch, Bezzy, Berean, Ezra, Gideon, Solomon, Selah, Nehemiah ✅
  - Live stats: tasks completed, messages24h, lastActive ✅
  - refresh-data.mjs pulls from `workspace/shared-context/backlog.md`, `workspace/ops/in-flight.md`, and session logs ✅
  - Static HTML/JS — no server dependency ✅ (AC says "Static/no server required for initial version")
- **Failure reason:** Wrong path. Same pattern as BL-005's initial failure. `scripts/dashboard/` = shared workspace by established convention.
- **Fix required:** Copy/move all 5 files to `/Users/deaconsopenclaw/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/dashboard/`. Verify `outPath` in `refresh-data.mjs` resolves to correct location after the move.
- **Verdict:** FAIL → status updated to `open` in backlog.md. Bezzy notified via sessions_send.

## Stale In-Progress Check

No tasks currently in `in-progress` status in backlog.md. Nothing to flag.

---

## Blocked Tasks Review

- **BL-009** (Telegram topics audit) — `blocked (prune-candidate)` — no change, no staleness concern
- **BL-011** (Gmail digest spec) — `blocked (prune-candidate)` — no change, no staleness concern

Both are marked prune candidates per Enoch's direction. No action needed.
