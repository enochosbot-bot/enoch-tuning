# Nehemiah QA Sweep — 2026-02-26 22:00 CST

## Tasks Validated

### BL-002 | Berean | Spectrum Competitive Landscape
**Verdict: PASS → verified**

File: `shared-context/agent-outputs/spectrum-competitive-landscape.md` — present and complete.

Checked against AC:
- ✅ 6 competitors profiled (exceeds 5+ minimum): Edward Jones, Fisher Investments, Mercer Advisors, DFW boutique RIAs, Raymond James, Betterment/Vanguard
- ✅ Offerings documented for all 6
- ✅ Pricing signals included (with appropriate confidence caveats — no public RIA fee disclosures)
- ✅ Differentiation angles present — 6 demo talking points explicitly labeled
- ✅ Competitive gap analysis included (What Competitors Are NOT Doing section)
- ✅ Confidence ratings disclosed per section (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) — appropriate epistemic honesty

Additional: Summary table, research gaps documented, sources cited. BL-008 (Solomon demo script) dependency is confirmed unblocked.

### BL-003 | Ezra | LinkedIn Launch Week Posts
**Verdict: PASS → verified**

File: `shared-context/drafts/linkedin-launch-week.md` — present and complete.

Checked against AC:
- ✅ 5 posts present
- ✅ All within 100–200 words (131 / 167 / 193 / 160 / 149 — confirmed against file-level word count footer)
- ✅ Intro/Mission angle: Post 1 — Ridley Research positioning, ridleyresearch.com
- ✅ Policy insight: Post 2 — SEC AI governance gap for RIAs
- ✅ Data-driven take: Post 3 — zero AI at boutique tier, ROI math (matching BL-002 figures)
- ✅ Personal story: Post 4 — founder perspective, 26yo, DFW, in-person install
- ✅ CTA post: Post 5 — direct ask, ridleyresearch.com, flat fee, in-person
- ✅ Status correctly flagged as awaiting Solomon review + Deacon approval before posting

Note: ops/social-ops-policy.md still missing. Ezra improvised from task guidance — acceptable for this delivery, but the policy doc should be created before BL-004 (X posts) ships. Not blocking verification of BL-003.

### BL-013 | Bezzy | vidgen.py CLI
**Verdict: FAIL → reopened**

`scripts/vidgen.py` — does not exist. `scripts/` directory does not exist anywhere in the workspace.

Mission Pulse logged "verified" at 21:00 CST but the file cannot be located. This is either:
1. A false positive in Mission Pulse's verification step (it claimed the file exists without actually checking the path), or
2. The file was written to a different location than specified and the subagent reported the wrong path

AC not met:
- ❌ `scripts/vidgen.py` not found
- ❌ `scripts/vidgen-log.jsonl` not found
- All other acceptance criteria are unverifiable without the file

Bezzy must deliver the file at `scripts/vidgen.py` (create the `scripts/` directory if needed) and resubmit for QA.

## Stale In-Progress Check

No tasks are currently in "in-progress" status. All active tasks are "open" or "blocked". Nothing to flag.

## Agent Output Audit

| Agent | Tasks Open | Output Files Present |
|---|---|---|
| Berean | BL-006, BL-012 | spectrum-competitive-landscape.md ✅ |
| Ezra | BL-004 | linkedin-launch-week.md ✅ |
| Bezzy | BL-005, BL-013 | None found in scripts/ ⚠️ |
| Solomon | BL-008 | None yet (unblocked as of BL-002 verify) |
| Gideon | BL-007, BL-010 | None (expected — tasks still open) |

Bezzy has zero output in the workspace despite BL-013 being marked done. This warrants attention.

---

## Backlog Health

| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| open | 8 (BL-004, BL-005, BL-006, BL-007, BL-008, BL-010, BL-012, BL-013) |
| in-progress | 0 |
| done | 0 |
| verified | 3 (BL-001, BL-002, BL-003) |
| blocked (prune-candidate) | 2 (BL-009, BL-011) |

**Overall health: MODERATE.** Verified count growing; BL-013 false-positive is the main concern. Solomon (BL-008) and Gideon (BL-007, BL-010) have unstarted high-value tasks that should be picked up next cycle.
