## Verdict: DO NOT USE BL-003 Posts — USE BATCH 2 INSTEAD

Ezra's BL-003 posts are structurally solid and well-written. They are also built on the wrong thesis. The ICP has been locked to **bootstrapping small businesses & individuals** with a LEVERAGE frame. Every BL-003 post targets financial advisors and RIAs exclusively. Using them would be a go-to-market mistake.

**Three reasons this matters:**

1. **OPSEC** — Publicly positioning as an AI consultant for RIAs while employed at one creates career and reputational risk. Deacon's name + "AI for RIAs" in the same LinkedIn post is a liability. The ICP pivot eliminates this.

2. **Market size** — Boutique RIAs are a small, slow-moving market with long sales cycles and heavy compliance drag. SMB solo operators and bootstrappers are a vastly larger, faster-moving audience. The upside potential is not comparable.

3. **Competitive noise** — Every fintech vendor and AI consultant is pitching RIAs right now. The LEVERAGE frame for solo operators and small businesses has significantly less competition and a cleaner differentiation story.

## What to Use Instead

**Pitch Post (linkedin-pitch-post.md):** ✅ APPROVE as Post 1. Clean cold-audience positioning. The "third option" framing is strong. "Build an agent that handles it" as the pivot is exactly right.

**Batch 2 Posts (linkedin-batch2.md):** ✅ APPROVE with one note (see below). The LEVERAGE frame is the right idea to own on LinkedIn. Post 3 ("I run Ridley Research with no staff") is the strongest piece in the queue — authentic, specific, and makes the abstract concrete.

**Recommended posting order:**
1. Pitch Post (linkedin-pitch-post.md) — sets cold-audience positioning
2. Batch 2, Post 1 — "The leverage frame"
3. Batch 2, Post 2 — "The bad-at-it problem"
4. Batch 2, Post 4 — "The conversion, not the savings"
5. Batch 2, Post 3 — "One person, real output"
6. Batch 2, Post 5 — "What we actually build" (close/CTA)

## One Flag: Blog URLs

Batch 2 posts link to three blog URLs:
- `/blog/business-case-for-ai-agents` — **resolves (200 after redirect)** ✅
- `/blog/five-workflows-that-save-time` — **resolves (200 after redirect)** ✅
- `/blog/three-ai-employees-running-247` — **resolves (200 after redirect)** ✅
- `/products/` — **resolves (200)** ✅

All links are live. No action needed.

## On Ezra's BL-003 Posts

Do not delete the file — it represents real work and the financial advisor angle may be relevant for a future Spectrum-targeted content play. But it should not be used as Ridley Research's LinkedIn launch content. The ICP mismatch is fundamental, not cosmetic.

## Summary for Deacon

- **Trash the original Ezra LinkedIn posts for launch** — wrong audience (RIAs, not bootstrappers)
- **Use the Batch 2 + Pitch Post content** — right frame, right ICP, live URLs confirmed
- **Post 3 ("one person, no staff") is your best post** — lead with authenticity
- **Waiting on LinkedIn OAuth** — that's the only remaining blocker before scheduling
