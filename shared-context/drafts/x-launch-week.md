# X/Twitter Launch Week — Ridley Research
**Drafted by:** Ezra
**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Status:** Draft — awaiting Deacon approval
**Task:** BL-004
**Reference:** BL-003 LinkedIn posts (linkedin-launch-week.md)

---

## Post 1 — Intro/Mission

> Most advisors are manually copying data between 3 systems and onboarding clients with paper packets.
>
> That's not a workflow problem. That's an operations problem with a fix.
>
> Ridley Research installs that fix. ridleyresearch.com

**Character count:** 219
**Type:** Standalone
**Target audience:** Independent advisors, RIA operators, fintech-adjacent followers
**Notes:** Lead post for launch day. Punchy problem-framing before the solution drop. Mirrors LinkedIn Post 1 angle but cuts the preamble — X readers don't need setup. No hashtags per brand voice.

---

## Post 2 — Policy (Thread-Starter)

> The SEC's AI guidance for RIAs is essentially "figure it out responsibly."
>
> That's not a framework. That's a liability disclaimer.
>
> The real enforcement risk isn't using AI — it's deploying it without documented governance. Thread 👇

**Character count:** 230
**Type:** Thread-starter
**Target audience:** Compliance-aware advisors, RIA principals, fintech policy followers
**Notes:** Opens a thread on what actual AI governance looks like for independent advisors (ADV analogy, one-page policy, etc.). Drops mid-week to establish thought-leadership before the CTA. Mirrors LinkedIn Post 2 angle, compressed and sharpened.

---

## Post 3 — Data/Math

> Recovering 15–20 hrs/week across a lean advisory team = ~$40k in annual recovered capacity.
>
> The tooling costs under $400/yr.
>
> Most RIAs under $500M AUM are running the same tech stack from 2015. That math has an obvious answer.

**Character count:** 243
**Type:** Standalone
**Target audience:** RIA owners, ops-minded advisors, anyone who respects the math
**Notes:** Proof-point post. No fluff — just the numbers. Compressed from LinkedIn Post 3. Runs well standalone or as a follow-on to Post 2 thread. Intentionally leaves Ridley Research unnamed to let the stat do the work; reply can link to site.

---

## Post 4 — Story (Thread-Starter)

> I'm 26. I work at an RIA by day and run Ridley Research on the side.
>
> What made me start it: watching how much of an advisor's week disappears into work that doesn't require a CFP.
>
> AI handles that work. Most advisors just haven't had anyone set it up yet. 🧵

**Character count:** 258
**Type:** Thread-starter
**Target audience:** Young advisors, founder-adjacent audience, fintech Twitter broadly
**Notes:** Personal/founder origin post. Opens a thread walking through what "an advisor's week" actually looks like and where AI fits. X rewards personal takes — this matches that. Compressed from LinkedIn Post 4 with the theory stripped out.

---

## Post 5 — CTA

> In-person AI agent installs for RIAs and advisors. DFW.
>
> We map your workflows, build the automation around what you're already doing. Flat fee. One session. Working system.
>
> No generic platform. No 6-month project. ridleyresearch.com

**Character count:** 237
**Type:** Standalone
**Target audience:** DFW advisors ready to act, warm leads from earlier posts
**Notes:** Direct response post. Drops end of launch week after awareness posts have run. X-native rhythm: short declarative sentences, no throat-clearing. Mirrors LinkedIn Post 5 but cuts all the softening language — X doesn't need it.
