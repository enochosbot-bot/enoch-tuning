## Post 1 — Intro/Mission

Most financial advisors are still manually copying data between three software systems, triaging email by hand, and onboarding clients with paper packets.

That's not a workflow problem. That's an operations problem. And it has a fix.

Ridley Research exists to install that fix. We build AI agent systems for independent RIAs and financial advisors — systems calibrated to your actual workflows, your clients, your forms. Not a generic tool. Not a plugin. A working automation layer that recovers hours every week and makes your practice run like it's twice its size.

We focus on the DFW market, but the problem is everywhere. If you're a financial advisor running a lean practice and spending half your week on administrative work that AI could handle, that's a conversation worth having.

## Post 2 — Policy

The SEC's current AI guidance for investment advisers is essentially: "use it responsibly, document everything, and pray your compliance department figures it out."

That's not a framework. That's a liability disclaimer.

The real regulatory risk facing RIAs right now isn't using AI. It's using it without a documented governance structure. Firms that deploy AI tools without written policies covering model selection, output review, and client data handling are exposing themselves to enforcement action — not because the tools are illegal, but because regulators will assume you didn't think it through.

The advisors who get this right will treat AI governance like they treat their ADV: boring to build, essential to have, and worth updating every year.

If your firm is adding AI capabilities and hasn't written a one-page internal policy yet, that's where to start. Not because regulators are watching yet. Because they will be.

## Post 3 — Data

Most independent RIAs have zero AI automation in their operations. Not minimal — zero.

That's not an opinion. Every major RIA industry survey from the past two years points to the same gap: firms under $500M AUM are running the same tech stack they used a decade ago. Redtail or Wealthbox for CRM. eMoney or MoneyGuidePro for planning. Orion or Tamarac for reporting. All separate. All requiring manual data entry between them.

The math on fixing that is straightforward. Recovering 15 to 20 hours per week across a 9-person team — a conservative estimate for firms that implement AI workflow automation — translates to roughly $40,000 in recovered annual capacity. The tooling to get there costs under $400 a year.

That's not a technology investment. That's a math problem with an obvious answer.

The firms moving on this now will have a 2-to-3 year head start before custodians and platforms build generic versions. Generic will be fine for most firms. First-mover advantage is better.

## Post 4 — Story

I'm 26. I work at an RIA during the day and run Ridley Research on the side.

The thing that made me start it: watching how much of an advisor's week disappears into work that doesn't require a CFP. Client onboarding packets. Scheduling follow-ups. Manually pulling data from one system to update another. Work that's necessary but not advisory. Work that AI handles well.

The advisors I respect most in this industry are sharp on planning and relationships. They're also drowning in administrative overhead that compounds every year as their books grow. The tools to fix that exist right now. Most advisors just haven't had anyone show them how to set it up for their specific practice.

That's what I built Ridley Research to do. Practical installation. DFW first. No theory, no pitch decks about the future of AI. Just a working system in your practice by the end of the visit.

## Post 5 — CTA

If you're a financial advisor or RIA in the DFW area and you're spending more than 10 hours a week on administrative work that follows the same pattern every time — you have an automation problem, and it's solvable.

Ridley Research does in-person AI agent installs. We come to your office, map your actual workflows, and build an automation layer around what you're already doing. No subscription to a generic platform. No six-month implementation project. One session, one flat fee, one working system.

The first step is a conversation. No form to fill out, no automated email sequence, no consultation package to buy before we talk.

Go to ridleyresearch.com and reach out directly. If the timing is right, we'll get something on the calendar.
