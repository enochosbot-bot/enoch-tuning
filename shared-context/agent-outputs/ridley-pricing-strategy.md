# Ridley Research — Pricing Strategy Review
**Prepared by:** Solomon  
**Date:** 2026-02-27  
**Triggered by:** Berean research brief (x-bookmarks-digest-2026-02-27.md)  
**Audience:** Deacon — decision required before content team goes public with pricing

## Bottom Line Up Front

The $497 price is correct as a market-entry wedge. It is not correct as a permanent identity. The problem isn't the number — it's that there's nothing above it yet. Before content goes live with "$497 install" as the anchor, Deacon needs to name the tiers. One framing decision made now prevents a repositioning problem six months from now.

**Recommended action:** Define a three-tier structure before publishing any pricing. Then let content reinforce it from day one.

## The Pricing Question

Berean flagged the gap between Ridley Research's $497 entry point and market-rate AI automation work: $2K–$5K for a single workflow build, $25K–$60K for department-level AI OS. That gap is real. Here's how to read it.

**$497 is not underpriced — it's correctly scoped for what it is.** An in-person session that installs a working system and gets someone off the ground is a starter product. The market data Berean pulled ($500–$2K for "setup/training") confirms it's right in range. The issue isn't the price. The issue is that "install" is the only offer on the menu.

When someone experiences the $497 install, gets 10 hours a week back, and wants more — there's nowhere to go. Deacon has to invent the next offer on the spot, at whatever price feels right in the moment, with no anchor. That's the gap.

**The strategic risk of going live now:** If content launches with "$497 AI install" as the headline offer and the brand identity locks around that number, every future price increase reads as a betrayal. The people who followed the "$497 guy" didn't sign up for a $5K follow-on. But if content launches with a tiered structure where $497 is explicitly the *entry* — named, positioned, implying there's more above it — the upgrade path is baked into the brand from the start.

## What the Tier Structure Should Look Like

Three tiers. Named before content goes live. The names are a branding decision Deacon makes — these are working labels.

### Tier 1 — Solo Install ($497)
**What it is:** One session, in-person, DFW only. Deacon maps the client's actual workflows, identifies the highest-value automation targets, builds one working system before he leaves. Client walks away with something running, not a plan for something running.

**Who it's for:** Solopreneurs, freelancers, micro-businesses (1–5 people). Someone who has one big administrative pain point and wants it gone.

**Positioning signal:** "Starter" or "Solo" in the name tells the market this is the floor, not the ceiling.

**Why $497 works here:** Low enough to buy without a budget conversation. High enough to signal this isn't a side hustle. The install creates the relationship — the relationship creates the upsell.

---

### Tier 2 — Full Stack Build ($3K–$5K)
**What it is:** Multi-session engagement. Deacon audits the entire operation, maps all major workflow categories (email, scheduling, CRM, reporting, client comms), builds multiple integrated agents, trains the team, and hands off with documentation. Could include 30 days of support.

**Who it's for:** Small businesses with 2–15 employees that have multiple overlapping pain points. An e-commerce operator who needs order processing + customer service + inventory updates all connected. A real estate investor (Jacob Allen tier) managing deal flow + comms + docs.

**Why this number:** $2K–$5K is where the market prices single-workflow professional builds. At $3K–$5K, Deacon is selling a complete operational layer — multiple workflows, integration work, training. That's a defensible price for the output.

**Key constraint:** This requires more time than a single install. Deacon needs to know his own hourly math before locking a price. If it's 15 hours of work at $3K, that's $200/hour. If it's 30 hours, that's $100/hour. Both are fine — but he needs to know which one he's selling.

---

### Tier 3 — Retainer / AI Ops Partner ($1K–$2K/month)
**What it is:** Ongoing relationship. Deacon is the AI operations layer for the business — monitoring, iterating, expanding the system as the business grows. New workflows added as needed. Monthly check-in. On-call for when something breaks or a new use case comes up.

**Who it's for:** Clients from Tier 1 or Tier 2 who've seen the value and want to keep building. Also direct-sells to businesses that want ongoing coverage without doing a full build first.

**Why a retainer, not project pricing:** Recurring revenue stabilizes Ridley Research's income. One Tier 3 client at $1,500/month is $18K/year. Five is $90K/year. That's a business, not a side project. It also creates the financial runway to do fewer Tier 1 installs and more high-value work over time.

**The upgrade path logic:** Tier 1 → proves value → Tier 2 proposal → deeper build → Tier 3 offer → ongoing partner. The $497 install is a lead magnet that sells itself. The retainer is the real product.

## The Polymarket Question

Berean flagged a recurring pattern: multiple Polymarket/prediction market bookmarks saved by Deacon. The question is whether this is personal curiosity, a content angle, or a signal about where he wants to take Ridley Research.

**My read: personal curiosity. Don't build content around it.**

Here's why. Deacon is an RIA associate at a fiduciary firm. Prediction markets sit in a regulatory gray zone for financial professionals — not illegal, but not something to wave around publicly while building an AI consulting brand targeted at small businesses. The CFP exam is the current career milestone. Building a Polymarket/AI arbitrage content angle right now creates potential confusion about what Ridley Research actually does and who it's for, and could create compliance complications at Spectrum.

That said — the *underlying* interest is worth noting. Deacon is watching the intersection of AI and financial markets. That's a legitimate long-term content territory once the CFP is done, the brand is established, and he has more room to operate publicly. Park it for now.

## The BL-003 Flag (For Enoch)

One side note that came up in orientation: the LinkedIn posts from BL-003 (Ezra's draft) are RIA-focused and no longer match the locked ICP. Enoch's handoff already flagged them for the trash. BL-003 is marked "verified" in the backlog but the content is wrong for the brand as it now stands.

**Recommended:** Enoch reopens BL-003 and dispatches Ezra to rewrite around the LEVERAGE/bootstrapper ICP before any LinkedIn posts go live. The backlog status doesn't match reality on this one.

---

## Decision Points for Deacon

Three things need a decision before content launches:

**1. Approve the three-tier structure (or modify it)**  
The specific numbers in Tier 2 and Tier 3 are estimates — Deacon needs to validate against his actual time cost and what the market will bear in DFW. But the structure (Solo Install → Full Stack Build → Retainer) should be locked before any post goes live.

**2. Name the tiers**  
"Solo Install," "Full Stack Build," "AI Ops Partner" are working labels. Deacon picks the names that fit the brand voice. Ezra can workshop them once a direction is chosen.

**3. Decide how much pricing to show publicly**  
Options:
- **Show Tier 1 only ($497)** — lowest friction for inbound, but no upgrade signal
- **Show all three tiers** — full transparency, sets expectation that there's a premium path
- **Show Tier 1, describe Tier 2+ as "custom quote"** — middle ground; keeps the anchor visible while opening the door for larger conversations

My recommendation: Show Tier 1 publicly, describe Tier 2 and Tier 3 as "custom quote — starts at $3K" and "ongoing retainer — let's talk." Keeps the entry accessible while signaling there's more.

## Summary

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Is $497 underpriced? | No — it's correctly scoped. The gap is that nothing exists above it yet. |
| Should the upgrade path exist before content launches? | Yes. One framing decision now vs. a repositioning problem later. |
| What does the $5K version look like? | Multi-workflow Full Stack Build. See Tier 2 above. |
| Polymarket angle for content? | Not yet. Park it. Revisit post-CFP. |
| BL-003 LinkedIn posts? | Wrong ICP. Need rewrite before posting. Flag to Enoch. |
