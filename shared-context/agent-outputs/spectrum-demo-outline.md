## Ezra's Notes

**What changed:** Every talking point tightened and jargon stripped — sentences now land clean. Transitions added between all five sections so the flow reads like one argument, not five separate stops. Demo sequences rewritten to setup → punchline format; objection responses made direct and decisive.

**What was flagged:** Two live demos carry real risk of dying on stage (Zocks query inside Redtail, eMoney sync live). Pre-demo checklist already covers this — have screen recordings ready for both. Also: confirm M365 Copilot license status before the demo; walking in without knowing whether you already pay for it is a credibility gap.

**What's ready:** A non-technical advisor can pick this up cold and run a confident 30-minute demo. Every section flows into the next. No jargon. No filler.

---

## Strategic Frame (Read This First)

This is not a sales pitch. Deacon already works here — this is an internal proposal, and the tone should match. The goal is buy-in for a two-week pilot, not a commitment to anything. Keep it collegial. Make the ask feel obvious and low-risk.

**Core message:** Every firm our size bleeds time on administrative work that doesn't require a CFP. The tools to stop that bleed are affordable, already proven, and available today. We either move first or catch up later — at higher cost.

**Anchor framing:** Redtail is the hub. Nothing is being replaced. We're connecting what we already have.

**The one objection to pre-empt:** Data security. Name it yourself before anyone else does. It shows you did the homework, and it removes the biggest blocker before it becomes one.

## Demo Flow

---

### SECTION 1 — OPENING HOOK (3–5 min)
*Get them to feel the problem before you show the solution.*

**Don't open with a slide. Open with a question:**
> "Show of hands — how much of your day is actual advisory work versus moving information between systems?"

Let the silence sit. Don't rescue it.

**Then give it a number:**
- The average advisor burns ~3 hours a day on manual administrative tasks
- Across a 9-person team: 60–80 hours a week lost to work that doesn't require a CFP
- That's not a complaint. That's an opportunity with a dollar sign on it.

**And here's the timing:**
- 18 months ago, fixing this cost enterprise money. Today it doesn't.
- Orion just launched enterprise AI (Denali) — but it's enterprise-only, unavailable to us right now.
- Every boutique RIA in DFW is running the same fragmented stack we are — Redtail, eMoney, Orion, Outlook, SharePoint — with zero automation tying them together.
- The firms that move in the next 6–12 months build a 2–3 year head start on everyone who waits.

> "We're not here to overhaul anything. We're here to connect what we already have."

*That line is your transition. Move directly into the five pain points.*

---

### SECTION 2 — PROBLEM STATEMENT (5 min)
*Name the friction they live with every day. Be specific — vague problems get vague buy-in.*

Five pain points. Five chapters for the demo.

1. **Email** — Outlook is a firehose. Triage is manual. Client requests get buried under newsletters and compliance notices.
2. **Forms** — LaserApp is gone. Instafill is the replacement — but right now, every post-meeting form fill is 30–60 minutes of manual entry per client.
3. **Reporting** — Weekly KPIs require pulling from multiple systems and reformatting by hand. 4–6 hours per cycle.
4. **Data sync** — Client address changes, new accounts, onboarding records — manually entered across Redtail, eMoney, and SharePoint. Same work, multiple times, with drift errors.
5. **Document retrieval** — Files stored in SharePoint are dark inside Redtail. You can't find or act on them from within your own workflow.

> "Right now, we're the integration layer between our own tools. That's what this fixes."

*You've just named five problems they already know. The walkthrough solves them one by one.*

---

### SECTION 3 — PRODUCT WALKTHROUGH (15–20 min)
*Show, don't tell. Lead with the strongest demo, close with the biggest time save.*

---

#### Demo 1: Email Triage — *The Opener*
**Setup:** "We spend up to an hour a day just sorting Outlook. Watch what happens when we let an agent do it."

An agent scans the inbox, categorizes by urgency and type, labels and archives the noise, and delivers a prioritized summary ready for your 5-minute review.

**Before:** 45–60 min/day of manual sorting.  
**After:** 5-minute review of a pre-sorted priority queue.

**Show:** Inbox → agent runs → sorted output with labels.

**Punchline:** "This is a 30-minute setup. It pays for itself in week one."

---

#### Demo 2: Form Auto-Fill via Instafill
**Setup:** "LaserApp is gone. This is the replacement — and it's better."

Instafill pulls from Redtail to pre-populate custodian forms. Meeting ends — the forms are already drafted. You review and sign.

**Before:** 30–60 min of manual entry per client interaction.  
**After:** Review and sign. Done.  
**Cost:** $20–66/month. No per-user pricing.

**Show:** Real custodian form populated directly from a Redtail client record.

**Punchline:** "We were doing this by hand. We don't have to anymore."

---

#### Demo 3: eMoney ↔ Redtail Integration
**Setup:** "This one's already paid for. We're just not using it."

Native integration, already available on our plan. Flip it on. Client info updated in one system syncs to the other automatically.

**Before:** Manual data entry in both systems every time something changes.  
**After:** Update once. Done.  
**Cost:** $0.

**Show:** Client record updated in one system → auto-reflected in the other.

**Punchline:** "Free. Already ours. Zero reason not to turn it on."

---

#### Demo 4: Zocks Document Intelligence
**Setup:** "Everything we've stored in SharePoint is already there — Zocks makes it usable."

Zocks connects SharePoint to Redtail. Meeting notes, client files, historical docs — all searchable and actionable from within your Redtail workflow.

**Before:** Documents sit in SharePoint. You can't reach them from within Redtail.  
**After:** Search any client document without leaving your workflow.

**Show:** Query a client document from within Redtail.

**Punchline:** "We've been filing documents we couldn't actually find. Now we can."

---

#### Demo 5: M365 Copilot — Excel Reporting — *The Big Close*
**Setup:** "Four hours becomes five minutes. Every week."

Copilot for Excel generates weekly KPI reports from raw data on command. No more manual pull-and-format.

**Before:** 4–6 hours of manual data work per report cycle.  
**After:** Prompt → formatted report in minutes.  
**Cost:** $30/user/month. *(Confirm whether the firm already has licenses before the demo.)*

**Show:** Raw data in → Copilot prompt → formatted report out.

**Punchline:** "This is the report you spend half a day on. We just did it in five minutes."

---

*Five demos. Five problems solved. Now show them why doing nothing is the riskier choice.*

---

### SECTION 4 — DIFFERENTIATION (5 min)
*Make "moving first" feel urgent, not optional. Reference the competitive landscape — don't read it, just cite it.*

> "I looked at what every firm competing for our clients is doing on this. Here's what I found."

| Competitor | AI/Automation Status |
|---|---|
| Edward Jones (local) | Near zero — manual intake, phone scheduling |
| Fisher Investments | Internal portfolio systems only — client-facing workflows unchanged |
| Mercer Advisors | Salesforce Einstein for CRM reporting only — no workflow automation |
| Local boutique RIAs | Zero. Same stack as us, same manual ops. |
| Raymond James | Platform AI built by corporate — advisors can't customize it |

**The point:**
- Every direct peer is running the same fragmented stack with zero automation
- Larger firms have enterprise tools — but those tools are rigid and built for scale, not for how a 9-person fiduciary firm actually works
- We're relationship-first. We're local. We're fiduciary. AI makes us *operationally as fast* as a firm twice our size — without giving up what makes us different

> "We don't need to beat Fisher. We need to beat the boutique down the street who's still emailing PDFs."

**The math:**
- Conservative estimate: 15–20 hours/week recovered across the team
- At $50/hour blended rate: **$39,000–52,000/year in recovered capacity**
- Total cost to implement: **~$360/year**
- **That's 100–140x ROI before we add a single new client**

*Now close with a specific ask and a specific date.*

---

### SECTION 5 — CLOSE / CTA (5 min)
*Don't leave the room with "let's think about it." Leave with a pilot and a date.*

The ask is a two-week solo pilot — zero risk to the firm, real data at the end.

**Phase 1 — Solo Pilot (2 weeks)**
- Deacon runs it alone
- Scope: email triage + eMoney↔Redtail sync (low-risk, high-visibility)
- Reports back with real numbers from actual workflow
- No firm data at risk. No compliance exposure.

**Phase 2 — Expand (weeks 2–4, if pilot succeeds)**
- Add one more person
- Connect SharePoint via Zocks
- Turn on Instafill for post-meeting form fill

**Phase 3 — Full Rollout (Month 2–3)**
- All advisors
- Automated reporting via Copilot
- Full onboarding workflow

**The close:**

> "I'm not asking us to change how we work. I'm asking for two weeks to prove it. If the numbers don't show up, we stop. If they do, we move. Either way we have data instead of a guess."

---

**Anticipated objections — have answers ready:**

| Objection | Response |
|---|---|
| "What about client data security?" | Data stays local — no third-party cloud. Fully auditable. CrowdStrike published a security analysis confirming this is enterprise-proven. I can send you the link. |
| "What if it makes a mistake?" | Human in the loop for anything client-facing. We start with low-risk tasks — email triage, reporting. Nothing touches client accounts without a human sign-off. |
| "Who maintains it?" | I own it initially. Once it's configured, it runs without daily attention. Updates are one command. |
| "Is this replacing anyone?" | No. It's replacing the tasks nobody wants to do. Same team, same roles — just more time for actual advisory work. |
| "Why now? Can't we wait?" | Orion is building enterprise AI right now. In 12–24 months, every custodian will ship a generic version of this. Firm-specific customization is the advantage — and it takes time to build. The window is open now. |

## Pre-Demo Checklist
- [ ] Confirm M365 Copilot license status — do we already pay for it?
- [ ] Get O365 admin to create Redtail journaling rule (Outlook→Redtail email sync)
- [ ] Check whether eMoney↔Redtail integration was attempted before and why it didn't stick
- [ ] Confirm Redtail plan includes API/integration access
- [ ] Test Instafill free trial with a real custodian form before demo day
- [ ] Confirm Zocks Document Intelligence availability on the firm's plan
- [ ] Find out why LaserApp was dropped — use that context to shape the Instafill pitch
- [ ] Estimate the firm's current hours/week on manual form work — use as your baseline
- [ ] Prepare screen recordings as fallback for any live demo that might fail *(priority: Zocks and eMoney sync)*

---

## What This Is NOT

- Not a pitch to replace Redtail, eMoney, or Orion — they stay, they get connected
- Not an enterprise AI overhaul — five targeted fixes to the five biggest friction points
- Not a commitment to anything beyond a 2-week solo pilot
- Not a public-facing play — this is an internal proposal; nothing here references Ridley Research
