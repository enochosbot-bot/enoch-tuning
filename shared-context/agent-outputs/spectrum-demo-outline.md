# Spectrum Advisors — Demo Script & Outline
**Prepared by:** Solomon  
**Date:** 2026-02-26  
**Task:** BL-008  
**Demo:** Early March 2026 — In-person, Spectrum Advisors office  
**Format:** Live demo, ~30-45 minutes  
**Audience:** Spectrum leadership and/or ops staff (9-person RIA)  
**Source research:** BL-002 competitive landscape, existing Spectrum Presentation Script, spectrum-demo.md  
**Status:** Draft — Ezra to polish prose after Solomon strategy review; Deacon approves before use

## Strategic Frame (Read This First)

The demo is not a pitch. Deacon works here. This is an internal proposal — collegial, not sales-y. The goal is buy-in for a pilot, not a contract close. The ask should feel low-risk and obvious.

**Core message:** Every firm our size is buried in the same administrative friction. The tools to eliminate it cost next to nothing and are already proven in production. We either move first in our market, or we catch up later at higher cost.

**Anchor:** "Redtail is the hub. Everything else feeds into it." Nothing is being replaced — the existing stack is being connected and automated.

**Biggest objection to pre-empt:** Data security. Address it before anyone asks.

## Demo Flow

---

### SECTION 1 — OPENING HOOK (3–5 min)
*Goal: Make them feel the problem before you show the solution.*

**Open with a question, not a slide:**
> "Quick show of hands — how much of your day is actual advisory work versus moving information between systems?"

Let the answer land. Don't fill the silence.

**The math:**
- Average advisor: ~3 hours/day on manual administrative tasks
- Across a 9-person team: 60–80 hours/week lost to work that doesn't require a CFP
- That's not a complaint — that's an opportunity with a number attached

**Why now:**
- 18 months ago, the tools to fix this cost enterprise money. Today they're affordable for a 9-person firm.
- Orion just launched enterprise AI (Denali) — but it's enterprise-only, not available to us yet
- Every boutique RIA in DFW is running the same fragmented stack we are: Redtail, eMoney, Orion, Outlook, SharePoint — with zero automation connecting them
- The firms that move in the next 6–12 months build a 2–3 year head start

> "We're not here to overhaul anything. We're here to connect what we already have."

---

### SECTION 2 — PROBLEM STATEMENT (5 min)
*Goal: Name the specific friction points they live with every day.*

Walk through the five pain points already documented in prep research. These are the demo's five chapters:

1. **Email** — Outlook inbox is a firehose. Triage is manual. Client requests get buried in newsletters and compliance notices.
2. **Forms** — LaserApp was dropped. Instafill is the replacement — but right now, post-meeting form fill is a 30–60 min manual exercise per client.
3. **Reporting** — Weekly KPI reports require pulling from multiple systems and reformatting by hand. 4–6 hours per cycle.
4. **Data sync** — Client address changes, new accounts, onboarding records — manually entered across Redtail, eMoney, SharePoint. Repeated work, repeated errors.
5. **Document retrieval** — Zocks Document Intelligence unlocks SharePoint data that currently sits dark and unsearchable from within Redtail.

> "We are the integration layer between our own tools. That's what this fixes."

---

### SECTION 3 — PRODUCT WALKTHROUGH (15–20 min)
*Goal: Show, don't tell. Live demos where possible. Screen recordings as fallback.*

**Demo order: lead with the strongest, close with the biggest.**

#### Demo 1: Email Triage (Strongest Opener)
- **What:** Agent scans inbox, categorizes by urgency and type, labels and archives noise, delivers a prioritized summary
- **Before:** 45–60 min/day of manual sorting
- **After:** 5-min review of pre-sorted priority queue
- **Show:** Inbox before → agent runs → sorted output with labels
- **Talking point:** "This is the zero-cost, 30-minute fix that pays for itself in week one."

#### Demo 2: Form Auto-Fill via Instafill
- **What:** Instafill pre-populates custodian forms from Redtail data. Meeting ends → forms are already drafted.
- **Before:** 30–60 min manual entry per client interaction
- **After:** Review and sign — data pulled automatically
- **Cost:** $20–66/month. Zero per-user pricing.
- **Show:** Real custodian form populated from Redtail client record
- **Talking point:** "LaserApp is gone. This is the replacement — and it's better."

#### Demo 3: eMoney ↔ Redtail Integration
- **What:** Native integration, already available on our plan — just needs to be turned on
- **Before:** Manual data entry in both systems when client info changes
- **After:** Update once, syncs everywhere
- **Cost:** $0
- **Show:** Client record updated in one system → auto-reflected in the other
- **Talking point:** "This one's free. It's already paid for. We're just not using it."

#### Demo 4: Zocks Document Intelligence
- **What:** Unlocks SharePoint document data into Redtail — meeting notes, client files, historical docs become searchable and actionable
- **Before:** Documents in SharePoint are dark — can't pull them from within Redtail workflow
- **After:** Search and retrieve any client document from within Redtail
- **Show:** Query a client document from within Redtail workflow
- **Talking point:** "Everything we've stored is already there. Zocks makes it usable."

#### Demo 5: M365 Copilot — Excel Reporting (The Biggest Time Save)
- **What:** Copilot for Excel generates weekly KPI reports from raw data automatically
- **Before:** 4–6 hours of manual data pull and formatting per report cycle
- **After:** Prompt → formatted report in minutes
- **Cost:** $30/user/month (check if licenses already exist before the demo)
- **Show:** Raw data in → Copilot prompt → formatted report out
- **Talking point:** "Four hours becomes five minutes. Every week."

### SECTION 4 — DIFFERENTIATION (5 min)
*Goal: Connect the demo to the competitive reality. Make "moving first" feel urgent, not optional.*

**Use the competitive landscape directly — don't read it, just reference it conversationally:**

> "I looked at what every firm competing for our clients is doing on this. Here's what I found."

| Competitor | AI/Automation Status |
|---|---|
| Edward Jones (local) | Near zero — manual intake, phone scheduling |
| Fisher Investments | Internal portfolio systems only — client-facing workflows unchanged |
| Mercer Advisors | Salesforce Einstein for CRM reporting only — no workflow automation |
| Local boutique RIAs | Zero. Same stack as us, same manual ops. |
| Raymond James | Platform AI built by corporate — advisors can't customize it |

**The point:**
- Every direct peer is running the same fragmented stack with zero automation
- Larger firms have enterprise tools — but those tools are rigid and can't be customized to how *we* work
- We're fiduciary. We're local. We're relationship-first. AI makes us *operationally as fast* as a firm twice our size while keeping what makes us different.

> "We don't need to beat Fisher. We need to beat the boutique down the street who's still emailing PDFs."

**Capacity math:**
- 15–20 hours/week recovered across the team (conservative)
- At $50/hour blended rate: $39,000–52,000/year in recovered capacity
- Total cost of implementation: ~$360/year
- **That's 100–140x ROI before we add a single new client**

---

### SECTION 5 — CLOSE / CTA (5 min)
*Goal: Land a specific, low-risk next step. Not "let's think about it" — a pilot with a date.*

**The ask is a pilot, not a rollout:**

**Phase 1 — Solo Pilot (2 weeks)**
- Deacon runs it alone
- Email triage + eMoney↔Redtail sync (both low-risk, high-visibility)
- Reports back with real numbers from actual workflow
- No firm data at risk, no compliance exposure

**Phase 2 — Expand (2–4 weeks, if pilot succeeds)**
- Add one more person
- Connect SharePoint via Zocks
- Turn on Instafill for post-meeting form fill

**Phase 3 — Full Rollout (Month 2–3)**
- All advisors
- Automated reporting via Copilot
- Full onboarding workflow

**The close:**

> "I'm not asking us to change how we work. I'm asking for two weeks to prove it. If the numbers don't show up, we stop. If they do, we move. Either way, we have data instead of a guess."

**Anticipated objections — have answers ready:**

| Objection | Response |
|---|---|
| "What about client data security?" | Data stays local. No third-party cloud. Fully auditable. CrowdStrike published a security analysis — this is enterprise-proven. |
| "What if it makes a mistake?" | Human in the loop for anything client-facing. Start with low-risk tasks (email, reporting). Nothing touches client accounts without approval. |
| "Who maintains it?" | Deacon owns it initially. Once configured it runs autonomously. Updates are one command. |
| "Is this replacing anyone?" | No. It's replacing the tasks nobody enjoys. Same team, same roles — just more time for the actual work. |
| "Why now? Can't we wait?" | Orion is building enterprise AI now. In 12–24 months, every custodian will have a generic version. Firm-specific customization is the advantage — and it takes time to build. The window is right now. |

## Pre-Demo Checklist
- [ ] Confirm M365 Copilot license status (already paid for?)
- [ ] Get O365 admin to create Redtail journaling rule (Outlook→Redtail email sync)
- [ ] Check if eMoney↔Redtail integration was attempted before and why it didn't stick
- [ ] Confirm Redtail plan includes API/integration access
- [ ] Test Instafill free trial with a real custodian form before demo day
- [ ] Confirm Zocks Document Intelligence availability on firm's plan
- [ ] Ask why LaserApp was dropped (shape Instafill pitch accordingly)
- [ ] Estimate firm's current hours/week on manual form work (use as baseline)
- [ ] Prepare screen recordings as fallback for any live demo that might fail

---

## What This Is NOT

- Not a pitch to replace Redtail, eMoney, or Orion — they stay, they get connected
- Not an enterprise AI overhaul — five targeted fixes to the five biggest friction points
- Not a commitment to anything beyond a 2-week solo pilot
- Not a public-facing play — this is an internal proposal; nothing here references Ridley Research
