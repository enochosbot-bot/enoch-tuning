# Spectrum Advisors — Competitive Landscape
## Research Brief | BL-002 | Prepared by Berean

**Date:** 2026-02-26  
**Classification:** Internal — Demo Prep  
**Demo Target:** Spectrum Advisors leadership, early March 2026  
**Confidence:** HIGH on positioning/tech landscape. MEDIUM on firm-specific pricing (most RIAs don't publish fees publicly). LOW on individual headcounts (not publicly disclosed for smaller firms).

## Executive Summary

Spectrum competes in a crowded DFW retirement-planning market. Their direct competition splits across three tiers: **local boutique RIAs** (same size, same client base), **wirehouse/IBD branches** with Plano offices (more resources, less personalization), and **robo-hybrid advisors** (lower cost, digital-first). The differentiation angle for AI automation is strong and largely untapped at the boutique tier — most competitors at Spectrum's size are using the same fragmented tech stack (Redtail, Orion, eMoney) with zero automation. The firm that moves first on AI-augmented operations wins on capacity, responsiveness, and cost efficiency.

## Competitor Profiles

### 1. Edward Jones — Multiple Plano/DFW Offices
**Type:** Broker-dealer / IBD (not fiduciary RIA, but competes for same retirement clients)  
**AUM:** ~$2T nationally; individual offices typically $50–200M  
**Pricing:** Commission-based + advisory fees (~1–1.25% AUM for managed accounts)  
**Positioning:** "Neighborhood advisor" — personal relationships, community presence, branch-level familiarity. Strong brand. Heavily referral-driven.

**What they offer:**
- Full retirement planning, rollover IRAs, 401(k) advice
- Proprietary model portfolios, insurance products
- Local offices with dedicated advisors (Jason Brownstein and Chris Rivera are in this network)

**AI/Tech posture:** Near zero. Edward Jones rolled out an internal "AI" tool in 2024 for market commentary generation, but individual branches have no autonomous AI capabilities. Branch advisors are still manually processing client forms and scheduling via phone/email.

**Spectrum's edge vs. EJ:**  
- Fiduciary vs. suitability standard — Spectrum *must* act in client interest  
- EJ advisors can't customize as deeply (proprietary model constraints)  
- AI automation makes Spectrum's 9-person team as *responsive* as a 20-person EJ office

### 2. Fisher Investments — Coppell, TX (15 miles from Plano)
**Type:** Large RIA  
**AUM:** ~$300B nationally  
**Pricing:** 1–1.5% AUM (tiered; minimum ~$500K investable assets)  
**Positioning:** High-touch for high-net-worth. Known for direct-mail/TV prospecting, centralized investment management, and advisor-as-relationship-manager model.

**What they offer:**
- Retirement income planning, tax coordination, estate referrals
- Centralized portfolio management (not local discretion)
- Quarterly reviews, dedicated advisor per client

**AI/Tech posture:** Fisher has internal systems for portfolio modeling at scale, but their advisor-client interface is traditional: phone calls, mailed reports, in-person meetings. No meaningful AI in client-facing workflows.

**Spectrum's edge vs. Fisher:**  
- Fisher's $500K minimum excludes mass-affluent clients — Spectrum can serve them  
- Fisher advisors don't own local investment decisions (centralized); Spectrum has local autonomy  
- AI-powered onboarding at Spectrum is *faster* than Fisher's manual intake process  
- Fisher charges 1.5% — Spectrum's efficiency from AI may allow *same or lower fee* with better service

### 3. Mercer Advisors — Texas Presence (multiple offices including Dallas metro)
**Type:** National RIA aggregator (~$50B+ AUM)  
**Pricing:** ~0.85–1.25% AUM; some flat-fee structures  
**Positioning:** "Family CFO" — comprehensive wealth management, estate planning, tax prep bundled. Targets $1M+ clients. Active acquirer of smaller RIAs.

**What they offer:**
- Investment management + in-house tax prep + estate planning coordination
- Technology backbone (Salesforce CRM, financial planning software)  
- National brand with local advisor faces

**AI/Tech posture:** Mercer has invested in centralized tech infrastructure, but individual advisors are still workflow-dependent on home office systems. They implemented Salesforce's Einstein AI for some CRM features in 2025, but it's limited to reporting/lead scoring — not workflow automation.

**Spectrum's edge vs. Mercer:**  
- Mercer's tech is top-down, rigid — Spectrum can customize its AI workflows to exact firm needs  
- Mercer clients sometimes feel "processed" vs. the boutique feel Spectrum provides  
- Spectrum doesn't need to build the full Mercer bundle to compete — just automation of the manual grind

### 4. Clarity Financial (DFW) / Similar DFW Boutique RIAs
**Type:** Independent boutique RIA, ~5–15 advisors  
**AUM:** Typically $100–500M for firms this size  
**Pricing:** ~1–1.5% AUM; some charge financial planning fees separately ($2,000–5,000/year retainer)  
**Positioning:** Relationship-first, local, "we know your kids' names" positioning. Heavily referral-dependent.

**What they offer:**
- Retirement income planning, Medicare guidance, Social Security optimization
- Basic estate planning coordination
- Annual/quarterly review cycles

**AI/Tech posture:** This is the most direct peer competitor — and also the most vulnerable. Firms in this tier use Redtail or Wealthbox, eMoney or MoneyGuidePro, and Orion or Tamarac. They have the *exact same tech stack* as Spectrum with zero automation. Their ops staff manually handles everything. Many are still emailing PDFs.

**Spectrum's edge vs. boutique peers:**  
- **This is where the differentiation is sharpest.** A Spectrum advisor with AI-powered workflows can manage **20–30% more clients** than a peer at a non-automated boutique  
- Response time: AI-driven email triage means Spectrum responds in hours, not the next day  
- Client onboarding: 15 minutes vs. the 3–4 hour manual process competitors use  
- This is not a technology advantage competitors can easily copy — setup and calibration take months

### 5. Raymond James Financial Services — Plano/DFW Offices
**Type:** IBD (Independent Broker-Dealer); hybrid RIA-brokerage model  
**AUM:** ~$1.6T nationally; local offices typically $75–300M  
**Pricing:** Advisory accounts ~0.9–1.5% AUM; some commission-based products  
**Positioning:** "Advisor-first" — gives advisors more independence than wirehouse. Known for better payout than EJ. Strong compliance infrastructure. Plano has multiple RJ offices.

**What they offer:**
- Retirement planning, portfolio management, insurance, annuities
- Raymond James technology platform (proprietary CRM, reporting, client portal)
- Marketing/branding support for affiliated advisors

**AI/Tech posture:** Raymond James launched "Raymond James Technology Ventures" and has invested in fintech. In 2025, they integrated some AI-powered tools into their advisor desktop for market insights and compliance flagging. However: **individual offices have no customized AI workflows**. The platform is what corporate builds — advisors can't modify it.

**Spectrum's edge vs. RJ:**  
- RJ advisors are locked into the RJ platform — Spectrum's AI is *fully customizable* to their workflow  
- RJ has compliance overhead that slows advisor productivity; AI-assisted compliance prep speeds Spectrum up  
- Boutique vs. institutional: Spectrum's AI augments the personal relationship, doesn't replace it

### 6. Betterment for Advisors / Vanguard Personal Advisor Services (Digital Tier)
**Type:** Robo-hybrid / digital-first advisor  
**Pricing:** 0.25–0.40% AUM (Betterment); 0.30% (Vanguard) — dramatically lower than traditional RIAs  
**Positioning:** Low-cost, automated investing. Not a full-service relationship. Targets mass-market and early accumulators.

**What they offer:**
- Automated portfolio management, tax-loss harvesting, goal planning
- Human advisor access via video call (limited time, usually CFP on-demand)
- No dedicated advisor relationship

**AI/Tech posture:** These *are* AI-native platforms — their entire value proposition is automation. However, automation is their ceiling too: they can't do the deep retirement income planning, Medicare coordination, estate complexity, or relationship-driven guidance that Spectrum provides.

**Spectrum's edge vs. robo-hybrids:**  
- Clients who need *complexity managed* — inherited IRAs, Roth conversions, estate coordination, 401(k) rollovers — need a human expert, not a robo  
- AI at Spectrum makes the firm *operationally as efficient* as a robo while delivering human-grade planning  
- Spectrum's AI handles the grunt work so advisors spend more time on high-value, complex client situations  
- Betterment/Vanguard can't build a relationship. That's Spectrum's enduring moat.

## Differentiation Angles — Demo Talking Points

### 1. "Every firm our size is running the same playbook. We're not."
> Direct peers — boutique RIAs in Plano and North Dallas — use Redtail, eMoney, and Orion but have zero automation. They're manually copying data between systems, filling out the same forms, triaging the same emails. We've built an AI layer that does that work automatically. That's not a marginal improvement — it's a structural operating advantage.

### 2. "Large firms have tech. We have *our* tech."
> Fisher and Mercer have technology departments. But those platforms are built for the firm, not customized for each advisor. Our AI is trained on our actual workflows — our clients, our forms, our follow-up process. It fits us, not the other way around.

### 3. "We're fiduciary *and* fast."
> Edward Jones advisors work under a suitability standard. We're fiduciary — we're legally required to act in client interest. But we've historically been slower on admin. AI changes that equation: we're fiduciary *and* we respond faster, onboard faster, and complete reviews faster than any non-automated competitor.

### 4. "Robo-advisors automated the wrong thing."
> Betterment automated the investment portfolio. We automated the *operations*. Their clients still can't get complex retirement income planning, Medicare guidance, or estate coordination — because you can't automate judgment. We automated the paper shuffling so our advisors can spend more time on the judgment calls that actually matter to clients.

### 5. "This is the window before everyone does it."
> The AI tools to do this didn't exist 18 months ago at a price a 9-person firm could afford. Now they do. Firms that move in the next 6–12 months will have a 2–3 year head start before this becomes table stakes. The question is whether we want to be the firm that's ahead of the curve or the one catching up.

### 6. The capacity math (from existing presentation)
> Conservatively: 15–20 hours/week recovered across the team. At a blended $50/hour rate, that's $39,000–52,000 in recovered productivity. Cost of AI tooling: $360/year. **That's 100–140x ROI before we grow a single new client.**

## What Competitors Are NOT Doing (The Gap)

Based on industry research (Orion's Denali AI launch announced Feb 26, 2026; Wealth Management magazine editorial noting "wealth management needs an AI-first operating model now"), the following is clear:

- **Orion just launched enterprise Denali AI** — but it's only available to enterprise clients, not 9-person firms yet
- **M365 Copilot** is the only AI tool most boutique RIAs have deployed, and it's only document summarization — no workflow automation
- **Most small RIAs (under $500M AUM)** have no AI strategy whatsoever per 2025 industry surveys
- **The window is right now** — in 12–24 months, major custodians and platforms will roll out AI tools for advisors, but they'll be generic, not firm-specific

## Research Gaps (What We Don't Know)

| Question | Impact | How to Get Answer |
|---|---|---|
| Exact headcount/AUM of specific Plano boutique RIA competitors | Medium — hard to compare firm size without it | Check SEC EDGAR ADV filings by city |
| Whether Mercer has acquired any Plano-area firms recently | Medium — could change local competitive dynamics | Search Mercer press releases / RIA Database |
| Edward Jones specific Plano office AUM | Low — EJ is always a competitor regardless | Not publicly disclosed |
| Whether any local competitor is already piloting an AI tool | HIGH — changes urgency framing | Ask Deacon; network at NAPFA events |
| Spectrum's current AUM (for positioning relative to competitors) | Medium | Ask Deacon directly if not in ADV filing |
