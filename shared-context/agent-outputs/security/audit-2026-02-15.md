# Security Audit — 2026-02-15

## Summary
ngrok killed per last audit (confirmed dead). Tailscale installed but not running — the replacement path is stalled. macOS 15.7.4 still pending (7 days now). OpenClaw brew cask one version behind.

## Findings

### MEDIUM — macOS Updates Pending (8 Days, Including Point Release)
**Evidence:** `softwareupdate -l` shows: macOS Sequoia 15.7.4 (restart required), macOS Tahoe 26.3 (major upgrade), Safari 26.3, Xcode CLI Tools 26.2. Current: macOS 15.6. Same findings as 2026-02-14 audit — no progress.
**Risk:** Security patches accumulating. Point releases contain CVE fixes. Week-old unpatched system.
**Fix:** `sudo softwareupdate -i "macOS Sequoia 15.7.4-24G517" --restart` (schedule during downtime). Safari and Xcode updates don't require restart: `sudo softwareupdate -i "Safari26.3SequoiaAuto-26.3" -i "Command Line Tools for Xcode 26.2-26.2"`

### MEDIUM — Tailscale Installed But Not Connected
**Evidence:** `tailscale` binary at /opt/homebrew/bin/tailscale. LaunchAgent `homebrew.mxcl.tailscale` loaded (exit code 1). macOS system extension running (application.io.tailscale.ipn.macsys). `tailscale status` returns "failed to connect to local Tailscale service." Priorities.md lists Tailscale as the ngrok replacement.
**Risk:** ngrok was killed (good), but the replacement isn't operational. No secure remote access path exists. If remote access is needed, the temptation to re-spin ngrok returns.
**Fix:** Open Tailscale app from /Applications, sign in, then `tailscale up --ssh`. The CLI daemon needs the GUI app running on macOS.

### MEDIUM — OpenClaw Brew Cask Version Mismatch
**Evidence:** `brew info openclaw` shows installed version 2026.2.13 in Caskroom, but `openclaw --version` reports 2026.2.14. `brew outdated` flags openclaw. Likely updated via npm/self-update but brew cask wasn't synced.
**Risk:** Brew won't track the correct version. Future `brew upgrade` may downgrade or conflict.
**Fix:** `brew upgrade openclaw` to sync cask state.

### MEDIUM — Outdated Packages (Homebrew + npm)
**Evidence:** Brew outdated: llhttp, gogcli, openclaw. npm global outdated: clawhub 0.6.0→0.6.1, npm 11.9.0→11.10.0.
**Risk:** Known vulnerabilities in outdated packages. llhttp is an HTTP parser — security-relevant.
**Fix:** `brew upgrade && npm -g update clawhub npm`

### LOW — API Keys in Environment Variables
**Evidence:** Shell env contains: OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN, GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY, NOTION_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, ELEVENLABS_API_KEY (values redacted). Visible to any process running as current user.
**Risk:** Any local process can read these. Lower risk now that ngrok is dead (no remote vector), but still not best practice.
**Fix:** Migrate to 1Password CLI (`op run`) or `.env` files with 600 permissions. Not urgent given localhost-only exposure.

### LOW — Multiple OpenClaw LaunchAgents
**Evidence:** ~/Library/LaunchAgents contains: ai.openclaw.gateway, com.openclaw.nosleep, com.openclaw.shekels, com.openclaw.spread-bot, com.openclaw.watchdog.
**Risk:** Attack surface increases with each daemon. If any are unused, they're unnecessary exposure.
**Fix:** Audit each agent's purpose. Remove unused ones: `launchctl bootout gui/$UID/<label> && rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/<file>`
