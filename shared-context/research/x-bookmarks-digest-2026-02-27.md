## NEW BOOKMARKS (2)

### 1. @yevrrah — High-Revenue Business Concept
**Preview:** "This concept will make someone way more than $100k (a few million) and you could..."
**Topic:** AI/automation business opportunity — specific concept not visible from preview
**Relevance to Ridley Research:** High. Deacon is actively building Ridley Research's $497 install service and looking for scalable revenue angles. If this is an AI-enabled business model, it's directly on-point.
**Action needed:** Read full tweet. If it's a specific productized AI workflow, surface to Solomon for strategic consideration.
**Confidence:** Low on specifics — preview too truncated.

### 2. @lorden_eth — AI Arbitrage Bots on Polymarket
**Preview:** "For those who are trying to build AI arbitrage bots on polymarket / Polymarket la..."
**Topic:** Prediction market AI trading — building automated arbitrage systems on Polymarket
**Relevance to Ridley Research:** Medium-Low for primary business (financial advisory context could make it interesting), but this is speculative tech territory. Cross-references the existing @bl888m bookmark (Polymarket $157K arbitrage spec) already in the library.
**Action needed:** Review full tweet. If it contains implementation detail that builds on the @bl888m spec, flag for Deacon's personal curiosity file rather than business pipeline.
**Confidence:** Medium — Polymarket AI is a recurring theme in his bookmarks.

## CONTEXT: RECENT BOOKMARK THEMES (Last ~72 Hours)

Several existing bookmarks from the Feb 25-26 window are worth flagging for ongoing relevance:

### HIGH RELEVANCE — Ridley Research Business
- **@lukepierceops** — AI/automation pricing tiers: $500–$200K. Validates Ridley Research's $497 entry price and shows the path to $5K–$25K full department builds. **Ezra-worthy content angle.**
- **@noahiglerSEO** — AI agent for plumbing company lead response (24 min → 60 sec, 60% conversion lift). Concrete home-service case study. **Strong Ridley Research demo data.**
- **@WorkflowWhisper (x2)** — Profitable local business workflow pricing ($800–$6K per workflow). Direct overlap with Ridley Research's service model.

### MEDIUM RELEVANCE — Content/Awareness
- **@thisguyknowsai** — Scrapling: undetectable web scraping for OpenClaw (784x faster than BeautifulSoup, bypasses Cloudflare). Operational tool for Berean/research pipeline.
- **@kloss_xyz** — Radical Simplicity & Candor Audit prompt. Useful internal tool for evaluating Ridley Research's own systems.
- **@boringlocalseo** — Getting local business mentioned by ChatGPT in 72 hours via press release strategy ($200 cost). Content angle for Ridley Research blog.

### LOW RELEVANCE / NOISE
- Various URL-only posts (no visible content)
- Crypto/Web3 content not aligned with Deacon's focus
- Generic AI tool lists

## HANDOFF RECOMMENDATIONS

**→ Ezra (content):**
- The @lukepierceops pricing tier breakdown + @noahiglerSEO plumbing case study together make a strong data-backed article: *"What Businesses Are Actually Paying for AI Automation in 2026"* — positions Ridley Research's $497 price as the smart entry point into a $500–$200K market.

**→ Solomon (strategy):**
- The repeated Polymarket AI arbitrage theme (@bl888m + @lorden_eth) is worth a 5-minute strategic consideration: is there a Ridley Research play in AI-assisted financial tools for RIA clients, or is this just noise?

**→ Deacon (direct):**
- Full @yevrrah tweet needs manual review — unknown revenue concept that may or may not be actionable.

## WHAT'S UNKNOWN
- Full text of both new bookmarks (script delta file not written in this run — re-run with `--detect-new` flag to populate)
- Whether @yevrrah concept is novel or another gated "comment for PDF" post
- @lorden_eth's specific Polymarket angle vs. the @bl888m spec already bookmarked
