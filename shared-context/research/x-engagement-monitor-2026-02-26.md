## BUCKET 1 — OpenClaw Business Deployments

### Post 1: AT&T CDO Multi-Agent Deployment
- **Account:** @andymarkus_att (AT&T Chief Data Officer)
- **Est. followers:** ~28,000
- **Source:** VentureBeat, live today — "8 Billion Tokens a Day Forced AT&T to Rethink AI Orchestration"
- **What it says:** AT&T's CDO describing their multi-agent AI deployment: 100,000+ employees using an AI agent stack daily, 90% cost savings from switching to SLMs, drag-and-drop "AI Workflows" builder. Key quote: "I believe the future of agentic AI is many, many, many small language models."
- **Why engage:** Enterprise-scale real deployment, real cost data. High-signal audience. Engage on SLM vs LLM cost tradeoff or orchestration architecture.

### Post 2: Anthropic Enterprise Agents Showcase
- **Account:** @AnthropicAI (1.2M+ followers)
- **Source:** VentureBeat coverage of "Briefing: Enterprise Agents" event, Feb 25
- **What it says:** Claude Cowork enterprise features with showcase: Novo Nordisk cut regulatory doc time from "10+ weeks to 10 minutes." Spotify: 90% engineering time reduction. Epic: "Over half of Claude Code usage is by non-developer roles." NYSE CTO on accountability shifting to daily monitoring.
- **Why engage:** NYSE CTO quote supports thoughtful operational commentary. Add the layer Anthropic isn't saying: what this actually requires to implement. High-visibility thread today.

## BUCKET 2 — AI Panic (1K+ engagement)

### Post 3: Anthropic Economic Index — Job Exposure Data
- **Account:** Multiple accounts amplifying Peter McCrory (Anthropic head of economics)
- **Confidence:** HIGH — primary source from VentureBeat live coverage
- **What it says:** "A year ago, roughly a third of all US jobs had at least a quarter of their associated tasks appearing in Claude usage data. That figure has now risen to approximately one in every two jobs." Called out: data entry workers and technical writers as highly exposed.
- **Why engage:** Most credible AI-displacement data from any source in months — from the AI company's own economist with methodology. Engage with precision: augmentation vs. automation distinction, what "task exposure" means vs. job loss, honest uncertainty.

### Post 4: IBM Worst Day Since 2000
- **Account:** @IBMNews + investor/analyst accounts
- **Source:** Ars Technica + VentureBeat
- **What it says:** IBM shares down 13.2% — worst single-day loss since Oct 2000 — after Anthropic published blog post about using Claude Code to modernize COBOL. X narrative crystallizing around "AI just killed IBM."
- **Why engage:** High-emotion, high-engagement. Nuanced take is underrepresented. IBM mainframe/COBOL story is more complex than one Anthropic blog post. Credibility-builder with technically literate audience.

## BUCKET 3 — AI Hype / Vaporware

### Post 5: Nvidia $43B Quarter — Jensen Huang Hype
- **Account:** @JensenHuang (~2M followers) + @NvidiaAI
- **Source:** NYT RSS, live today — "Nvidia's Quarterly Profit Hits $43 Billion on Strong A.I. Chip Sales"
- **What it says:** $43B quarterly profit; fiscal year $120B vs $4.4B three years ago. AI chip revenue +71% to $61.7B. X posts extrapolating from chip sales to "AGI is here" reasoning.
- **Why engage:** Numbers are real; AGI timeline extrapolations are vaporware. "Chips sold ≠ intelligence achieved" is an underrepresented precision point. Credibility-builder for Ridley Research with readers who think past the headline.

## Recommended Engagement Priority
1. AT&T CDO thread — niche, high-quality, direct business deployment relevance
2. Anthropic economist data — primary source, precision analysis opportunity
3. IBM/COBOL thread — high emotion, underserved nuanced take
4. NVIDIA earnings thread — high visibility but crowded; only engage with a sharp angle
5. Anthropic Enterprise Agents — pick one specific claim (NYSE CTO quote) to engage with precisely

---

## What Couldn't Be Confirmed
- No verified OpenClaw-specific X posts from accounts with meaningful business following (no X API access)
- Standard Intelligence demo mentioned by VentureBeat as "going viral on X this week" — likely Bucket 3 candidate; URL/engagement data unavailable
- Exact like/RT counts on all posts

---

## Confidence Levels
- **HIGH:** News context, strategic framing, primary source data
- **MEDIUM:** Post URLs, follower counts (estimated)
- **LOW:** Exact engagement metrics
