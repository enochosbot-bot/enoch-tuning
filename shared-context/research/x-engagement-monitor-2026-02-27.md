## BUCKET 1 — OpenClaw Business Deployments

### 1. @TerDawnDeBoe — Forbes (Feb 25, 2026)
- **URL:** https://www.forbes.com/sites/terdawn-deboe/2026/02/25/why-the-openclaw-acquisition-is-a-surprising-win-for-small-business-roi/
- **Est. followers:** 15-30K
- **Topic:** OpenAI acquisition of OpenClaw as a small business ROI win; enterprise-grade security for agentic automation
- **Engagement angle:** Deacon is running the exact thesis she's writing about — real-world practitioner vs. theorist dynamic. High brand alignment.

### 2. VentureBeat — KiloClaw Launch (Feb 25, 2026)
- **Story:** Kilo launches KiloClaw — hosted OpenClaw platform on Fly.io, deploy in 60 seconds
- **Engagement angle:** Direct threat/opportunity for Ridley Research's $497 install positioning. The install isn't the hard part — configuration and use-case design is. That's the defensible value.

## BUCKET 2 — AI Panic Posts

### 3. Fortune/MSN — "AI Toddler" (Feb 24, 2026)
- **Headline:** "AI agents that do your work while you sleep sound great. The reality is far messier—'it's like a toddler that needs to be overseen'"
- **Search terms:** "AI agents toddler" or "AI does your work while you sleep"
- **Engagement angle:** Deacon has actual deployment experience. Can speak to the oversight critique from a practitioner lens — either validate with nuance or push back with ROI framing.
- **Est. engagement:** This headline type generates 1K+ reactions on X.

---

## BUCKET 3 — AI Hype / Vaporware

### 4. OpenAI x OpenClaw Acquisition Wave
- **What's happening:** OpenAI acquired OpenClaw (confirmed via Forbes Feb 25). Generating breathless hype from large AI accounts.
- **Search terms:** "OpenClaw acquisition" or "OpenAI OpenClaw"
- **Engagement angle:** "Deployed OpenClaw 3 months before this acquisition. Here's what the hype gets wrong and right." Cuts through noise with credibility.

### 5. @steipete (Peter Steinberger, OpenClaw creator)
- **Handle:** x.com/steipete
- **Est. followers:** 40-80K
- **What to find:** His reaction to the OpenAI acquisition of his tool
- **Engagement angle:** Ground zero for the OpenClaw X conversation this week. Practitioner reply in that thread would stand out sharply.

---

## Priority Order
1. @steipete acquisition thread (highest-leverage, most targeted)
2. @TerDawnDeBoe Forbes post (direct brand alignment)
3. "AI toddler" Fortune thread (broad visibility)
4. KiloClaw VentureBeat post (strategic positioning)
5. Acquisition hype wave (broader, noisier)

---

## Key Strategic Note
**KiloClaw changes the Ridley Research pitch.** If hosted OpenClaw deploys in 60 seconds, the $497 value isn't the install — it's the configuration, use-case design, and hand-holding through adoption. That positioning needs to be explicit on ridleyresearch.com.

## Limitations / Upgrade Path
- X auth walls blocked direct post URL extraction
- Future batches would benefit from authenticated X session or X API credentials
- Bookmarks sync integration would also resolve this
