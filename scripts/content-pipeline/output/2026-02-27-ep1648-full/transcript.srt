1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But as soon as you start playing games, I start playing games, and at any moment, I can hit that yay button.

2
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Now my words and my rules, I just enforce them all right?

3
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm there at the first day.

4
00:02:36,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Now my words and my rules, I just enforce them all right?

5
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm there at the first day.

6
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Now my words and my rules, I just enforce them all right?

7
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm there at the first day.

8
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Now my words and my rules, I just enforce them all right?

9
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm there at the first day.

10
00:04:42,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Now my words and my rules, I just enforce them all right?

11
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Jesus is the way and the life and the king of Israel.

12
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We just leave with love.

13
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Now my words and my rules, I just enforce them all right?

14
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Now my words and my rules, I just enforce them all right?

15
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
God is using me, He's breaking me down, removing all of the, you know, riches person, all of this so I can serve Him.

16
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I think I think they've been extremely unfair to you.

17
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:30,000
People that are scrambling trying to protect their ever shrinking share of what they have are foolish, it's all going, it's all going away.

18
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This country is being ripped apart and raped and looted.

19
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We're being slowly poisoned and in some cases quickly murdered and assassinated.

20
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And we're killing ourselves every day inadvertently with the kinds of things that we eat and breathe and drink and see.

21
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
People have got to start to radically begin to obey their conscience and tell the truth and do the right thing.

22
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And people have got to start to get courageous and this is the time for everybody to turn and look to God and to pray and to ask for strength and to ask for wisdom to get through this time and to transform and sanctify this country.

23
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The alternative is that there will be no country.

24
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Is it really only as big as low gas prices? Is it really only so big as bringing inflation and gas prices and the corporate tax rate back down?

25
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Is that about waiting for someone to come in and change the policy and make it better?

26
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's a personal decision that we all have to make to become soldiers of Christ.

27
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Oh, wow, wow.

28
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What's up, look at the time.

29
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What's up, look at the time.

30
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The broken plot is right again.

31
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What's up, look at the time.

32
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What's up, look at the time.

33
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Your ability informed.

34
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I am the loser.

35
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What I want you.

36
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

37
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Hello.

38
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Got faces to beat.

39
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Good evening, everybody.

40
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You're watching America First.

41
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
My name is Nicholas J. Flimchester.

42
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We have a great show for you tonight.

43
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,420
everybody

44
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:09,560
You got that

45
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:32,320
No one's allowed to say that the blind is quintessential part of this, that the blind

46
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,160
of our people is something that is essential.

47
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:57,160
But we are different, that America was different because we are different.

48
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:05,440
Palantir is an AI data analytics company that uses artificial intelligence to look at

49
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,240
vast amounts of data and create insights.

50
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,000
If the government has an amount of data which is kind of unimaginable, if you've got

51
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,280
every phone call, every email, every transaction, every photograph of a license plate on the

52
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:27,000
highway satellite data, it's too much data for a bureaucracy to sift through.

53
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,960
Palantir comes in and interprets the data using algorithms, using artificial intelligence,

54
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,920
using software to make vast amounts of data usable.

55
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
That's what they are.

56
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,440
And so many of the people that worked with Elon that came into the government through

57
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,760
Doge worked with Palantir.

58
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,880
Now that Doge is finished, Palantir seems to be just getting started.

59
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:21,960
How much everybody can I just say, are you trusty?

60
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:41,960
How much everybody can I just say, are you trusty?

61
00:11:41,960 --> 00:12:01,960
How much everybody can I just say, are you trusty?

62
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:11,960
How much everybody can I just say, are you trusty?

63
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:21,960
How much everybody can I just say, are you trusty?

64
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:41,960
How much everybody can I just say, are you trusty?

65
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:51,960
How much everybody can I just say?

66
00:12:51,960 --> 00:13:11,960
How much everybody can I just say, are you trusty?

67
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:31,960
How much everybody can I just say, are you trusty?

68
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:51,960
How much everybody can I just say, are you trusty?

69
00:13:51,960 --> 00:14:09,960
How much everybody can I just say, are you trusty?

70
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:31,960
How much everybody can I just say, are you trusty?

71
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:59,960
How much everybody can I just say, are you trusty?

72
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:17,960
How much everybody can I just say, are you trusty?

73
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:49,960
How much everybody can I just say, are you trusty?

74
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:19,960
How much everybody can I just say, are you trusty?

75
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:29,800
And the reason why is because it's not good to share a big business, it's not good to

76
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:55,600
share a big business, it's not good to share a big business, it's not good to share a big business

77
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:21,400
It's not good to share a big business, it's not good to share a big business, it's not good to share a big business

78
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:47,200
It's not good to share a big business, it's not good to share a big business, it's not good to share a big business

79
00:17:47,200 --> 00:18:13,000
It's not good to share a big business, it's not good to share a big business, it's not good to share a big business

80
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:38,800
It's not good to share a big business, it's not good to share a big business, it's not good to share a big business

81
00:18:38,800 --> 00:19:04,600
It's not good to share a big business, it's not good to share a big business

82
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:30,400
It's not good to share a big business, it's not good to share a big business, it's not good to share a big business

83
00:19:34,600 --> 00:20:00,400
It's not good to share a big business, it's not good to share a big business, it's not good to share a big business

84
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:26,200
It's not good to share a big business, it's not good to share a big business, it's not good to share a big business

85
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:48,400
It's not good to share a big business, it's not good to share a big business, can you share a big business

86
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Thank you so much everybody, can I just say, are you trusty?

87
00:21:48,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Thank you so much everybody, can I just say, are you trusty?

88
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:28,400
Thank you so much everybody, can I just say, are you trusty?

89
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:42,400
When I get home, I want you, hello, hello, hello, hello, I got places to be here

90
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:56,400
Good evening everybody, you're watching America First, my name is Nicholas J. Fuentes, we have a great show for you tonight

91
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Thank you so much everybody, thank you so much everybody, can I just say, are you trusty?

92
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:15,000
My love has got no money. He's got his strawberries. My love has got no power. He's got his strong beliefs. My love has got no fame. He's got his strawberries. My love has got no money. He's got his strong beliefs.

93
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:29,000
One more and more. People just want more and more. Freedom and love. What he's looking for. One more and more. People just want more and more. Freedom and love.

94
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:53,000
What he's looking for. Freedom and love. What he's looking for. Freedom and love.

95
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:01,000
If we don't have freedom on the internet in the age of AI, we are going to be mind-raped every day forever.

96
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Think about anything you've ever said or done in the vicinity of your phone's camera or microphone. Everything you've ever put into your phone.

97
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And even things that are not necessarily so scandalous, but even things like your favorite restaurants, your geo location because your phone also has a GPS. They know where you are at all times. They know where you go and when. They know what you buy. They have access to your bank account.

98
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:39,000
AI will literally know everything about you. Everyone you know, your relationship to them, your taste, your preferences, your habits, your whereabouts, your routines, your schedule, when you are sleep.

99
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
They know how much REM sleep you're getting. They know you're resting heart rate. They know how many calories you consume.

100
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Think about the ways that they manipulate you. You have a computer in your refrigerator, computer in your car, computer in your home security system, computer in your everything, computer in your clothes, your watch, your glasses, your VR headset, your alarm clock.

101
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:09,000
You have a smart home, economy of things. It's like total rate of everybody by the system forever.

102
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:30,000
My life is like a first person video game. You know, this is like, this is my primary. This is me like walking down the hall. This is my primary weapon.

103
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Press circle to interact. Press circle to interact with this item.

104
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:55,000
At the end of the day, here's a question. Is it worth it to save the country? Does the country matter? Is it worth it to preserve our civilization? Is it worth it to preserve our religion?

105
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:10,000
May it be bigger than that? Is the truth worth it? What is the truth worth to you? What is telling the truth worth to you? Is it worth something? Nothing? What are you willing to give to tell the truth?

106
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:31,000
All you need is Jesus. All you need is prayer. These material appetites, they will never be satisfied. And even if they are, it will never be an adequate substitute for communion with our Holy Father with somebody with the author of the world.

107
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And every mother and father understands the love for a child. And that is how we were made, we were designed that way.

108
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Because through that experience, we could understand by analogy God's love for us. It says in Revelation that God will wipe away every tear.

109
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And that's like to mean. It makes you want to cry when I read that.

110
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:04,000
People experience these things in their lives. We've all been there. You feel like the whole world is against you, the walls are closing in.

111
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And you read something like that that says that God, like our Father, our Creator, is going to wipe your tears off your face.

112
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Christianity is love. Our God is love.

113
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:45,220
A

114
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:57,220
Jesus Christ was our past. Jesus Christ is our present now. And Jesus Christ is our future after we die on it.

115
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:03,220
We want this century to be the most Christian century in the history of plan.

116
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,220
Jesus Christ is our future.

117
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,220
Jesus Christ is our future.

118
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,220
Jesus Christ is our future.

119
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,220
Jesus Christ is our future.

120
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,220
Jesus Christ is our future.

121
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,220
Jesus Christ is our future.

122
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm not supposed to be here tonight.

123
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I'm supposed to be here.

124
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm not supposed to be here tonight.

125
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Good evening everybody.

126
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
You're watching America First.

127
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
My name is Nicholas J. Flinches.

128
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
We have a great show for you tonight.

129
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm not supposed to be here tonight.

130
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm not supposed to be here tonight.

131
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm supposed to be here tonight.

132
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I'm supposed to be here tonight.

133
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Pleasure to have guests in charge!

134
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm supposed to be here tonight.

135
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Pleasure to have guests in charge.

136
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm supposed to be here tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight.

137
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:46,880
We can't be held hostage by this country forever.

138
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,980
When will it end?

139
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,980
When will any leader put their foot down and re-sort American sovereignty?

140
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,980
Do we run the world or does Israel?

141
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,980
Do we even run our own punch?

142
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
Do we control our own military?

143
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,980
Do we control our own government or does Israel?

144
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,980
When I get home, I want you.

145
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,980
I'm not supposed to be here tonight.

146
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,980
I'm supposed to be here.

147
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:25,980
I'm doing drugs with a low health.

148
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:31,980
My fight says nothing but a screw in a photo.

149
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:37,980
I stretch my head but my throat just goes up.

150
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:55,980
When I get home, I want you.

151
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,980
Hello, hello, hello.

152
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:03,980
Hello, I got places to be here.

153
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,980
Good evening, everybody.

154
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,980
You're watching America First.

155
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,980

We have a great show for you tonight.

157
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,980
My name is Nicholas Jake Fuentes.

158
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,980
We have a great show for you tonight.

159
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:52,980
They believed a lion could be brought to heel.

160
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,980
They have total control.

161
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,980
But a lion could from his courage be pride.

162
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,980
Over every single thing.

163
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:05,980
But the lion himself would learn to kneel.

164
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,980
They pulled the string.

165
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:13,980
The lion would not care even if his lion died.

166
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,980
Things have to change.

167
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:20,980
That the lion himself would accept such a deal.

168
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,980
And they have to change right now.

169
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:28,980
In the end, it was only to themselves they had lied.

170
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,980
I am your voice.

171
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,980
I am your voice.

172
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,980
I'm your name.

173
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:09,980
.

174
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:16,980
.

175
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:23,980
.

176
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:48,980
.

177
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:52,980
.

178
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:59,980
.

179
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:09,120
more and more. We demand love. What he's looking for is from desire. My nonsense is purified.

180
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:16,720
It's from desire. My nonsense is purified. It's from desire. My nonsense is purified.

181
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:26,320
It's from desire. There is something involved where we have to forgive them. We do have to

182
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,920
forgive them for their ignorance. We do have to forgive them for their misunderstanding and we

183
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,360
have to embrace them and say, better late than never. Welcome to the right side of history.

184
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:44,000
Welcome to our our massive vision, our massive and ambitious vision for how we want the world to

185
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,680
be.

186
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,840
Hello hello hello hello hello hello hello that place is to be

187
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:31,040
Good evening everybody you're watching a miracle first my name is Nicholas Jake lunches we have a great show for you tonight

188
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:54,680
When can we expect real victory, and who's going to deliver it?

189
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:02,840
J.E. Vance, if they reveal birthright citizenship, his wife wouldn't be a citizen anymore.

190
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:09,080
I know, no other country, this is my home.

191
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:24,000
J.E. Vance, if they reveal birthright citizenship, his wife wouldn't be a citizen anymore.

192
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:54,000
J.E. Vance, if they reveal birthright citizenship, his wife wouldn't be a citizen anymore.

193
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:24,000
J.E. Vance, if they reveal birthright citizenship, his wife wouldn't be a citizen anymore.

194
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:54,000
J.E. Vance, if they reveal birthright citizenship, his wife wouldn't be a citizen anymore.

195
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:06,000
J.E. Vance, if they reveal birthright citizenship, his wife wouldn't be a citizen anymore.

196
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:16,000
J.E. Vance, if they reveal birthright citizenship, his wife wouldn't be a citizen anymore.

197
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:26,000
J.E. Vance, if they reveal birthright citizenship, his wife wouldn't be a citizen anymore.

198
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:36,000
J.E. Vance, if they reveal birthright citizenship, his wife wouldn't be a citizen anymore.

199
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:46,000
J.E. Vance, if they reveal birthright citizenship, his wife wouldn't be a citizen anymore.

200
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:56,000
J.E. Vance, if they reveal birthright citizenship, his wife wouldn't be a citizen anymore.

201
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:26,000
J.E. Vance, if they reveal birthright citizenship, his wife wouldn't be a citizen anymore.

202
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:56,000
J.E. Vance, if they reveal birthright citizenship, his wife wouldn't be a citizen anymore.

203
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:26,000
J.E. Vance, if they reveal birthright citizenship, his wife wouldn't be a citizen anymore.

204
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:56,000
J.E. Vance, if they reveal birthright citizenship, his wife wouldn't be a citizen anymore.

205
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:19,080
Thank you, guys.

206
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:38,560
Jesus is the way and the life and the King of Israel.

207
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,720
We just leave with love.

208
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,600
We're really at a crossroads here.

209
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,080
Look around you.

210
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,680
It's drag queens in schools.

211
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,040
It's 18-year-olds joining Holy Phant.

212
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,840
It's the Philphantic talk.

213
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,600
It's this country not having a border.

214
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:59,960
It's the idea that our kids and we, this generation, are never going to own us.

215
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,960
Think about it.

216
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,960
Never making an income to support a family.

217
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,960
Never being able to have a family.

218
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,960
People being corrupted before.

219
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,960
You're even a teenager by things on their phone.

220
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,960
Sick addiction, the technology.

221
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,960
The future is so bleak.

222
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,960
But that has changed the calculation.

223
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,960
God is using me.

224
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,960
He's breaking me down.

225
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,960
He's removing all of the, you know, riches person, all of this.

226
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,960
So I can serve him.

227
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,960
I think they've been extremely unfair to you.

228
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,960
Who is they, though?

229
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,960
We can't tell you they is, can't we?

230
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,960
There is no future if we do nothing now.

231
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,960
There is nothing to use.

232
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,960
People that are scrambling trying to protect their ever shrinking share of what they have

233
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,960
are foolish.

234
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,960
It's all going.

235
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,960
It's all going away.

236
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:59,960
This country is being ripped apart and raped and looted.

237
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:06,960
We're being slowly poisoned and in some cases quickly murdered and assassinated.

238
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,960
And we're killing ourselves every day.

239
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,960
inadvertently.

240
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,960
With the kinds of things that we eat and breathe and drink and see.

241
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:18,960
People have got to start to radically begin to obey their conscience.

242
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,960
And tell the truth and do the right thing.

243
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,960
People have got to start to get courageous.

244
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,960
And this is the time for everybody to turn and look to God.

245
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,960
And to pray and to ask for strength and to ask for wisdom to get through this time.

246
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,960
And to transform and sanctify this country.

247
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,960
And the alternative is that there will be no country.

248
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,960
Is it really only as big as low gas prices?

249
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:52,960
Is it really only so big as bringing inflation and gas prices in the corporate tax rate back down?

250
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,960
Is that about waiting for someone to come in and change the policy and make it better?

251
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,960
It's a personal decision that we all have to make.

252
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,960
To become soldiers of Christ.

253
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:50,960
So many does not murder Charlie Kirk because they voted for Kamala Harris.

254
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:57,960
People do not stab young girls on trains because they're born black.

255
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:04,960
People do not shoot Palestinians in the back of the head or cheer it on just because they're Jewish.

256
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,960
The people that do this are lost.

257
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:14,960
They have to be isolated and segregated out.

258
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,960
A new consensus must emerge.

259
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:22,960
Are you in favor of a society with meaning?

260
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,960
A society where life is sacred?

261
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,960
Where life has sanctity?

262
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:36,960
Where people's lives and their dignity and their integrity is respected?

263
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:47,960
Or are we going to live in a society that is a never-ending war between nihilistic tribes, warlords, savages, pagans?

264
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:56,960
I see an emerging consensus and I think that the mature people that actually love America, actually love our children.

265
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,960
The people that recognize the division, the peril that we're in.

266
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:07,960
We need to fortify a new consensus and rally the people of conscience.

267
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:15,960
The people of decency, the people of humanity, the people of charity towards their fellow man.

268
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,960
Against those that want to kill us.

269
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,960
Against those that laugh and celebrate when innocent people are harmed.

270
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,960
For any reason, for any ideological reason.

271
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,960
Against the people that are cruel.

272
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,960
The people that are hateful.

273
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,960
And by that I mean the people that are really cruel.

274
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,960
Not the people that say things you disagree with.

275
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,960
Not the people that are provocative.

276
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,960
Not the people that are sometimes angry.

277
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,960
But the people that are really cruel and really evil.

278
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,960
No, no, no, no.

279
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,960
What makes Christianity and Christ so different from the other religions.

280
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:09,960
Is that our religion is based on the bearing of suffering for the sake of even those that persecute us.

281
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,960
An overflowing of love.

282
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,960
An overflowing of self giving love.

283
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:22,960
So much if it cannot be contained.

284
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:29,960
An unconditional, absolute standard of love for all of God's children.

285
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,960
Even those that are misguided.

286
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,960
Even those that persecute us.

287
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,960
Even the most heinous among us.

288
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,960
That is what makes us difference.

289
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,960
That is what makes us good.

290
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:54,840
The Canary Mission is an Israeli-funded blacklist, which since July 2025 has been confirmed

291
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:59,280
to be used by the Trump administration to target students, professors and professionals

292
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:04,440
who oppose Israel and reside in the United States. This idea is part of an initiative created

293
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:09,960
by the Heritage Foundation. The same group responsible for the infamous project 2025.

294
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:14,000
In their initiative, titled Project Dester, they state that students participating in

295
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,680
pro-Palestinian protests and activism are supporting Hamas, a group that the United States

296
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:24,000
designates as a foreign terrorist organization. Therefore, pro-Palestinian students are considered

297
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,280
to be supporting terrorism and are subject to the revocation of visas, frozen bank accounts,

298
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:35,760
asset seizures, and the denial of basic constitutional rights. In effect, the Canary Mission serves

299
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:40,360
as a means to circumvent constitutional protections, allowing the federal government to engage

300
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:44,240
in intelligence gathering activities that would otherwise be considered unlawful. But

301
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:48,680
the Canary Mission is not alone. Palantir, another company closely aligned with the state

302
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:54,000
of Israel, uses AI-driven analytics to maintain private databases on U.S. citizens and currently

303
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,360
works with four federal agencies. While government contracting with the private sector is longstanding,

304
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:03,520
the prominent influence of Jewish groups within these increasingly powerful organizations warrants

305
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,000
careful examination.

306
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I renew the call for all able-bodied young American men, all of our elite human capital,

307
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,440
all of our geniuses, warriors, intelligent people to dedicate themselves to American sovereignty

308
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:26,680
and independence, as Christians, as Americans, as white people, as citizens of the United States.

309
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:32,200
And anybody that settles for anything less is just as much of an enemy I would actually

310
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,280
consider them worse than our oppressors.

311
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,720
So on Independence Day, it's important to reflect on the fact that we are an occupied nation.

312
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:44,720
Now, just like then, we're being ruled by a small country across an ocean, serving itself

313
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:49,440
at our expense, and as long as that is the case, I will always be obsessed with that.

314
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,360
As long as that is the case, I will always be speaking out against that and fighting against

315
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:57,760
that, and I will always be anchored, understanding that that is the fundamental struggle.

316
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,920
As long as our presidents have to kiss the wall in Israel and wear a small hat, as long

317
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,120
as they have to say that we want to make Israel great again and they're the greatest country

318
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:09,080
ever, and I will never be okay with that.

319
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,080
Ever.

320
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:16,120
And it doesn't matter what they offer me or us, it doesn't matter how they might try

321
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:22,160
to placate us, or appease our interests, the concessions they'll make, as long as that

322
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,920
is the case, it is unacceptable.

323
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,400
And that's what it means to be an American.

324
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:55,040
How did we get here?

325
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,040
This is not a timeline going back to 1948.

326
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:05,120
What had just happened before the 2016 election, Barack Obama created the Joint Comprehensive

327
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:12,800
Plan of Action, the JCPOA, or the Iranian Nuclear Deal, and Barack Obama brought together

328
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:18,440
China, Russia, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States and the European

329
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:24,800
Union to enforce a nuclear deal that restricts Iran's enrichment of uranium.

330
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:30,840
The early talks were conducted in secret, and the Israelis were furious, furious about

331
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:31,840
this.

332
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:36,800
The United Obama, Netanyahu, went to a joint session of Congress and gave a speech in

333
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:42,080
defiance of the American President, and its nuclear deal, and Congress gave 37 standing

334
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,080
ovation.

335
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,520
This is the background of Trump's first election.

336
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,320
2016 election happens.

337
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,800
Trump gets elected with the help of the Israelis.

338
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:52,800
You don't believe me?

339
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:53,880
There's a whole article about it.

340
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,200
It's an excerpt from James Bamford's book Spy Fail.

341
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:02,560
It goes in a great detail about the hidden collusion in the 2016 election.

342
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,560
It wasn't Trump and Russia.

343
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,200
It was Trump and Israel.

344
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:14,240
And why was Israel so hell-bent on getting a Republican elected in 2016 to scut all the

345
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,280
Iranian nuclear deal?

346
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,760
And that's exactly what happened.

347
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,760
That was the ask.

348
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:28,400
The United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.

349
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:34,080
In 2018, Donald Trump declares the IRGC, the Revolutionary Guard, which is the military

350
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:41,360
of the regime, a terrorist group, green lights, that group for sanctions, for attacks.

351
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:44,840
Now the United States is in a shadow war with Iran.

352
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:50,280
It culminates by January 2020 in the assassination of Qasim Soleimani.

353
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:57,760
Soleimani was the architect of the Axis of Resistance, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis,

354
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,760
Soleimani built all of it.

355
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,000
Are you starting to see Obama had this solved?

356
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,240
He made the deal.

357
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,200
The Israelis hated him for it.

358
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:10,920
They colluded with Trump to get him elected so that Trump would do maximum pressure and

359
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:17,120
create a ladder of escalation, pulling us out of the deal, declaring the IRGC terrorists,

360
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:20,840
then killing its leader, putting sanctions on the regime.

361
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:27,960
This is a war that started a long time ago that Trump made hot in 2018 and has been going

362
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:31,160
on for seven years.

363
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,600
That's the nature of forever wars.

364
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:40,600
Just like in Iraq, which went from 1990 until today, just like Libya, which went from

365
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:49,680
2011 to today, Syria, which went from 2011 to today, and Iran, which went from 2018 until

366
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,680
today.

367
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:53,440
That's the nature of forever wars.

368
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,680
And if you're not paying attention to those underlying forces, you're going to fall for

369
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,880
it again and again.

370
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:05,120
You're going to be surprised and confused and coping over and over.

371
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:12,120
And people are just tripping over themselves to do it again.

372
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:42,120
And people are just tripping over themselves to do it again and again and again.

373
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,960
It's like I started out like the Jews are oppressing us then it's like no no the Jews are oppressing all of you

374
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,440
Maybe I need to help

375
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:39,280
You asked me why I'm doing all this

376
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:45,840
But even if I told you why I doubt very strongly that the knowledge would change anything

377
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:51,680
But let's say that I take the time to explain it to you. What do you think would have been there?

378
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,960
You

379
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:14,480
It's America first but like actually it's kind of Israel first. The Jews in Israel has so much control over our government right now

380
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:24,320
We paved the way with our corpses, brothers and all the alt-writers that got banned all the alt-writers that got slandered even people that killed themselves

381
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,640
Our corpses paved the way for you now to walk over

382
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,280
And you can't give us

383
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:36,400
The knowledge men now you want to slam the door on us. It's not right. It's not right

384
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,360
Oh

385
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,560
Okay

386
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,800
Oh

387
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,080
Good evening everybody you're watching America first. My name is Nicholas J. Fuentes

388
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:35,280
We have a great show free tonight very excited to be back here with you tonight on Wednesday

389
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,480
We have a lot to talk about tonight lots to get into big show

390
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,320
The Jews

391
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:53,360
But they know the next generation is with us and they're writing about it in the New York Times

392
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:59,440
They said anywhere between 30 and 40% of the White House staffers and congressional staffers are groipers

393
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,680
That's an underestimate

394
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,760
That's an undercount

395
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:09,760
It all means nothing if we don't get our people in office if we don't get our people in government

396
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:13,520
And that's why I tell groipers don't let them put your name on a list

397
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,360
Hi, conceal your views like they did

398
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,640
Like they did

399
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,800
Don't let live in put you on a list

400
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:28,720
Your job is to get into the Ivy League your job is to get into these offices do what you need to do

401
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,520
Say what you need to say hold it close to the chest

402
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,920
But we bleed for America

403
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
That's why I like to raise the right hand

404
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:39,680
You don't have to broadcast it to everybody and you can say what you need to say

405
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,720
When we're in private

406
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,720
It's America first it's Christus King

407
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,640
And you're not going to know how many of us there are and you're not going to know which one of us we are

408
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,000
And you're not going to get a good count and you're not going to know all our names

409
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:58,720
And slowly but surely you will be encircled and you will be surrounded and one day you're going to wake up in the groiper party

410
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,320
You

411
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,800
But as soon as you start playing

412
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,920
I

413
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,480
Is

414
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:36,520
I'm gonna end up taking boys and gonna do an accent trick

415
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:39,520
But girls that don't want to put them on the set

416
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,520
Just know how to use a couple, not a bad tip

417
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:47,520
But just stop the track and then reverse the tension

418
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,520
See what they said, put them on the board

419
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,520
And then on the board, do an o-round

420
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,520
Okay, one more move

421
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,520
It's not even a cold a second

422
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,520
But don't have me back with the posis

423
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,520
It's too much that they want to always do a reset

424
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,520
It's too much that they want to end up on your head

425
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,520
Pray before you go to bed

426
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,520
Every day my mind will see

427
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:19,520
Now my words, now my rules, I've been forced to write

428
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:36,520
Every morning, I have everybody here in the world

429
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,520
Americanism, not globalism

430
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,520
Will be our credo

431
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:10,000
It's going to be only America first, America first.

432
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:16,000
The American people will come first once again.

433
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:27,000
With respect, the respect that we deserve.

434
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:42,000
From this day, it's going to be only America first, America first.

435
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Good evening, everybody.

436
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
You're watching America first.

437
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
My name is Nicholas J. Fuentes.

438
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
We have a great show for you tonight.

439
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Very excited to be back here with you tonight on Thursday.

440
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
It is Thursday, right?

441
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
We got a lot to talk about tonight.

442
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Lots to get into big show.

443
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
It's actually a huge show.

444
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
A featured story tonight.

445
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:06,000
We are once again getting into the negotiations between the United States and Iran on Iran's

446
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
nuclear program.

447
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,000
And we finally have what looks like a definitive update.

448
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I know maybe this topic feels stale.

449
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
It's kind of getting a little bit old for me.

450
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I like it, but there's not a lot of movement on it.

451
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:28,000
It's been probably about a month since the protests in January.

452
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
And it seems like we just have this uncertainty.

453
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:37,000
We have no idea if the US will act what it's going to be to what end.

454
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,000
But today, it seems like all of that has finally changed.

455
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:48,000
And as you know, this morning was the long anticipated third round of discussions between the US

456
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
and Iran.

457
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Once again, they were held in Geneva, Switzerland.

458
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:01,000
And it seems like if there was ever a definitive decisive moment, it was this morning, this morning

459
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
our time.

460
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:07,000
And the big development is that the talks seem to have utterly collapsed.

461
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Now, they say that there's going to be another round of discussions next week.

462
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
That's what everybody says.

463
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I would remind you, however, that just before Israel bombed Iran last year in June,

464
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,000
they had scheduled another round of talks.

465
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:28,000
So to me, that does not necessarily preclude the possibility of a military confrontation

466
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:34,000
this weekend or next week, even though they say the talks are ongoing.

467
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Now, the reason that I'm a little bit more confident today that we have some clue

468
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:44,000
as to where all of this is headed is because despite what we talked about last night,

469
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:49,000
we went to a little bit of what was said during the state of the union.

470
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,000
And there were some new statements from Rubio and Vance.

471
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
And we played devil's advocate.

472
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:00,000
We talked a little bit about a possibility for Trump to pursue an off ramp.

473
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
He seems to be looking for one at least.

474
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:11,000
But today, all of that was effectively debunked to the extent that there was any hope

475
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:16,000
that there is an off ramp that is viable or that Trump is looking for one.

476
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
We now know that is not the case.

477
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:24,000
And we know that because the US entered the talks today with a list of demands

478
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
and they are exactly the same.

479
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,000
It's the same list of demands that we've been dealing with for the past year.

480
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,000
And they are that Iran has to destroy its nuclear facilities.

481
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:40,000
So they actually have to go in and blow up all the infrastructure, which they've invested in.

482
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
They have to agree to never enrich uranium again.

483
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
And that's permanent. There's no sunset clause, nothing like that.

484
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,000
And not only did they have to forfeit their highly enriched uranium,

485
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
but they have to give it to the United States.

486
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:01,000
So there was talk earlier in the talks and the discussions that maybe Iran would give

487
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,000
some of the stockpile to a third country.

488
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:10,000
So they might give half of it to Russia, let's say.

489
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Well, the United States today is demanding that they give all of it to the United States.

490
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
And so these are the same demands.

491
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Again, this is really nothing new.

492
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
This is what they've been saying for the past couple of months.

493
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
This is what they said last year.

494
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
These have been the demands really since 2018.

495
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Destroy the nuclear program, no enrichment, no sunset clause.

496
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
And you got to give up what you've already enriched.

497
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
And that's the deal.

498
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Now, not only are these a list of demands that Iran is never going to accept,

499
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,000
but the United States isn't even offering anything in return.

500
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Iran, if they even are going to make any kind of a deal,

501
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:53,000
and they have made some concessions, they said they might dilute their stockpile.

502
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,000
They might give some of the stockpile again to a third country.

503
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:03,000
They would agree to slow or restrict enrichment for a period of time.

504
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Even if they made an agreement like that,

505
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:13,000
what Iran is asking for in return is massive and immediate sanctions relief.

506
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Because if they don't have it, then their country is going to collapse.

507
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
They need to fix the infrastructure.

508
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
They need electricity.

509
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
They need water.

510
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
They need food.

511
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,000
They need things to start coming back into the country.

512
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
So it doesn't even make sense for Iran to make a deal.

513
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:35,000
And they're not going to unless they get the floodgates for investment and commerce to open up.

514
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
And the US isn't even offering that.

515
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
They're giving basically no sanctions relief.

516
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:47,000
And the sanctions relief that they're giving is contingent upon Iran's compliance with the other demands.

517
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:53,000
So it's as I said last week, the week before, this is an ultimatum.

518
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
This has not changed.

519
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Trump gave Iran an ultimatum.

520
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,000
And the ultimatum is you're going to agree to all of our demands.

521
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,000
You give up entirely or we're going to war.

522
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
There's going to be no deal.

523
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
There's going to be no concessions.

524
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
There is not a compromise.

525
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
It's not even really a negotiation.

526
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Trump is saying it's a take it or leave a deal.

527
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,000
You're either going to agree to all this or we're going to war and that's it.

528
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
And Trump has not budged.

529
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
And that was clear today.

530
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Now the timeline is about to expire.

531
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:31,000
It was last Tuesday, not this previous Tuesday, three days ago.

532
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
It was the previous Tuesday.

533
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:43,000
So 10 days ago, I guess nine days ago, it was nine days ago that Trump gave Iran a 10 day to 14 day deadline.

534
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
So the 10 day, which is obviously sooner.

535
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
That's tomorrow.

536
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
14 days is Tuesday.

537
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:55,000
So the deadline that Trump imposed on himself and on Iran to make a deal.

538
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,000
It either expires tomorrow or it expires on Tuesday.

539
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
That would point toward

540
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:06,040
imminent strikes, either this weekend or next weekend. And so I think that is how all

541
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:11,520
of this is shaping up. Again, there are some headlines about maybe another last ditch

542
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:18,160
effort. They say that the Omani minister is coming tomorrow or tonight and he's going

543
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:22,280
to try to make a last ditch agreement and they say that they're scheduling another round

544
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:28,800
of talks and the Iranians say that it's going well. But how could it be going well? It's

545
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:35,080
the same program. It's been the same program since a year ago. So we are headed towards, excuse

546
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:39,520
me, we're headed towards a war. That's where all the arrows are pointing right now. So we're

547
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:46,200
going to get into that. We're also going to talk tonight about this major, major move

548
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:52,400
in the media industry. And we've had a rye on this one for a little bit and, you know,

549
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:58,880
it's being called an upset. But I guess that's only if you're not a conspiracy theorist.

550
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:06,680
So as you know, Larry Ellison, the Jewish billionaire CEO and chairman of Oracle, the software

551
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:13,560
giant has been trying to build a media empire. He has ambitions to build what will probably

552
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:21,480
become uncontested undoubtedly the number one media conglomerate in the world going

553
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:29,960
from no media holdings, basically no media portfolio at all to in the span of one year,

554
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:37,960
Larry Ellison now owns the media. And we've talked about this last year, his son David Ellison

555
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:44,840
acquired Paramount pictures for his media company, which is called Skydance. And it became

556
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:53,080
Skydance Paramount. And with Paramount, they acquired CBS, CBS news, number of television stations,

557
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:59,160
paramount pictures, paramount plus the streaming service. This is already a pretty substantial

558
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:05,320
media holding just as quickly as David Ellison acquired Paramount, they wanted to go after Warner

559
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:11,080
Brothers. And they set their sites on Warner Brothers, which is another massive media company,

560
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:17,320
and they made a bid for it. When they made the bid for Warner Brothers, it triggered an open

561
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:25,720
bid. And Warner Brothers went out and they solicited other offers. Netflix came in with a massive

562
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:31,960
substantial offer and Warner Brothers board approved that offer. And so literally up until yesterday

563
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:41,720
from December until yesterday, Netflix had a deal approved by the board. That was the program.

564
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:46,760
They were going to acquire Warner Brothers and that was it. It was looking like it was a done deal.

565
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:55,880
Well, at the last minute, Paramount Skydance came back with a better offer. Netflix gave Warner

566
01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:02,200
Brothers a seven day waiver to review the offer. And now this is the big announcement today,

567
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:09,800
Warner Brothers has accepted the offer. So you're now going to have Skydance Paramount and Warner

568
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:18,040
Brothers all under the Larry Ellison Empire. That is an addition to their holdings in TikTok,

569
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:26,280
which earlier this year, late last year, broke off from bite dance and formed its own independent

570
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:33,560
company. It's a US TikTok company. Larry Ellison owns a significant percentage of that owns the

571
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:41,640
algorithm and all the data. So now you've got Skydance Paramount, Warner Brothers, TikTok,

572
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:52,040
all part of the same family. So that's CBS, CBS news, CNN, Discovery Channel, Food Channel,

573
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:59,560
Nickelodeon, Paramount Pictures, Warner Brothers Studio, all of that HBO, HBO Max, Paramount Plus,

574
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:08,520
all of that plus TikTok under this one family. And as we've discussed, Larry Ellison is a close

575
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:14,680
personal friend of Benjamin Netanyahu, huge supporter of Israel. You could say this is the

576
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:22,360
biggest push in Israel's eighth front war to make the case for Zionism and for Israel's ongoing

577
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:27,800
expansionist war in the Middle East. And now it's a done deal. So we'll talk about that too.

578
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:34,040
And really the theme of the show tonight, you really have to step back and consider

579
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:40,520
who has this administration been a victory for? Who has this been a win for?

580
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:46,760
Think about what has come to pass in the second Trump administration, just these developments

581
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:52,600
today. We're going to war with Iran to pursue regime change to topple their government.

582
01:24:53,640 --> 01:25:01,000
The US government forced a sale of TikTok to Larry Ellison. Arguably the Justice Department

583
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:06,520
played a role in sabotaging the Netflix Warner Brothers deal. And now this new media conglomerate

584
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:12,680
has been created under this Zionist Jewish family. We're not even getting into tonight what has

585
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:19,000
happened on the Ivy League campuses, where the Department of Education has wielded the grants

586
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:25,640
and loans for the universities to get their faculty fired, to get their policies changed.

587
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:32,440
And so really when you look at the breadth of what Trump and this administration have done,

588
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:39,960
this is the most Jewish administration in history. And I know that sounds the way that it sounds.

589
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:48,360
But it's what it is. Who is up? Who's winning here? They have recaptured the Ivy League

590
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:53,480
universities. They're overthrowing the government in Iran, which they have always wanted to do.

591
01:25:53,880 --> 01:26:00,360
A Zionist Jewish family now has the largest media conglomerate in the world, or arguably

592
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:06,920
one of the largest media conglomerates in the world. You've got the State Department and DHS

593
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:14,360
actively deporting anybody that criticizes Israel on social media. Won't let people into the country

594
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:22,280
who have criticized Israel. It's endless like this. They're talking about another MoU,

595
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:30,520
another foreign aid bill for Israel. And we can't even get half a million deportations.

596
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:39,960
We can't even get a border wall. Think about this. You are being played. Who is it really for?

597
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:48,760
I I said it in 2024. It has come to pass in 25. You have to look at not simply what is not

598
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:56,280
happening, border wall deportations, tariffs, the rest, but what is happening for others?

599
01:26:56,280 --> 01:27:03,400
And how are they using the institutional power? How are they using the government to achieve it?

600
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:10,280
Think about the institutional capture that has occurred. Think about this game of musical chairs.

601
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:17,560
You got Ronald Lawter, chairman of the World Jewish Congress, his son-in-law is the chair of the

602
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:26,200
Federal Reserve. Okay, so a son-in-law of this guy's running the Fed. You have Larry Fink, the Jew that

603
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:32,200
runs BlackRock running the World Economic Forum. All the Ivy Leagues had to agree to these

604
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:40,040
onerous anti-antisemitism measures to unlock their federal money. We're going to war with Iran

605
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:47,000
after we did it last year and went to war with the Houthis. And now they have rebuilt or expanded

606
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:53,080
their ownership over the media. Now you've got the Ellison's running CBS, CNN, Warner Brothers,

607
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:57,480
Paramount, HBO Max, Paramount Plus, TikTok.

608
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:07,120
And you say, wow, and people thought that the great awakening would change things.

609
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:10,480
They thought, surely the people are aware.

610
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:14,320
How could it possibly get worse?

611
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:19,880
They say, some's got to give the goiim woke up and there's nothing they could do about

612
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:20,880
it.

613
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,960
Well, they did something about it.

614
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:23,960
Okay.

615
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:24,960
They did something about it.

616
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:28,880
It's called they got Trump elected and you fell for it.

617
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:32,240
They tricked you.

618
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,680
And it's literally this simple.

619
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:40,640
You look at Trump and you say, I see what you have done for them.

620
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:43,440
Do that for us also.

621
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:51,480
Look at what he has done for them to boarding anti-Semites blowing up, Harvard and all the

622
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:58,840
other IVs going to war with Iran, making this media conglomerate happen.

623
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:02,560
How about a free speech bill for the internet?

624
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:07,480
How about a constitutional right or legislative protections for our right to speak on the

625
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:08,480
internet?

626
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:10,280
How is that even being talked about?

627
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,280
No.

628
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,440
How about a border wall?

629
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:13,800
It's been 10 years.

630
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:14,800
No.

631
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:15,800
Hasn't even started.

632
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:16,800
How about Massey?

633
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,760
It goes on and on, truly.

634
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:26,320
And people think the arrangement is in reverse more on that later.

635
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:36,560
So what we'll get into all that it's, it's sort of hard to witness sometimes, you know,

636
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:37,560
it's hard to watch.

637
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:39,880
But what we'll talk about all that before we get into it.

638
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:43,240
I want our mind to smash the follow button on rumble smash a like button.

639
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:44,240

it out.

644
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:01,760
We also have our America first plus subscription.

645
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:06,840
If you want to support the show, people say, how can I support the show become a plus

646
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:07,840
subscriber?

647
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:09,240
It's 15 bucks a month.

648
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:11,280
That's the base level.

649
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:16,200
And you get access to every episode of the show, every piece of content I've ever made,

650
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:19,480
every interview, debate, commentary stream.

651
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:20,480
And you know what?

652
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,520
The website works really well.

653
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:28,480
So people complain that the show on rumble is a little buggy or they complain about the

654
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,880
lobby being too long.

655
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:35,600
We have a really good video player on the website and every show is cropped.

656
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,480
You have an MP3 version of it.

657
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,480
So it's probably the best way to watch the show.

658
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:43,160
That's America first dot plus for a hundred bucks a month.

659
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:45,480
You get access to the group chat with me.

660
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:46,480
And I'm in there.

661
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:47,680
I'm dropping knowledge.

662
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:50,840
I'm hanging out with the niggas.

663
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:56,160
And like I said, the results can be mixed at times.

664
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:58,520
I was complaining a little bit about it last night.

665
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,360
Some of you know, look, it's a group chat.

666
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:04,200
So niggas come into the group chat and they're off the goop.

667
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:06,560
And it just is what it is.

668
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:07,560
But it's a fun time.

669
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:09,600
And I drop a lot of bonus content in there.

670
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:16,200
So if you really want the, you really want the real stuff because here's the thing.

671
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:20,720
I can't even really say so much of the good stuff on the show because everybody just

672
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:24,000
clips it and takes it out of context.

673
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:29,160
So I can't even really be myself on the show because everybody just crashes out.

674
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:34,640
I make a joke about anything in every, you literally can't make a joke about anything.

675
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:36,440
You make a joke about women.

676
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:37,440
People freak out.

677
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:43,000
You make a joke about sloths, Albanians, Muslims, people lose their minds.

678
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,720
Kid Rock, Oliver Anthony.

679
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:47,360
You make jokes about this stuff.

680
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:50,240
People go crazy.

681
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:53,480
So the group chat is like, it's my safe space.

682
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:56,480
I feel free to create.

683
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:57,960
So check that out.

684
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:00,560
America first dot plus, all right.

685
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:04,120
With that out of the way, we're going to dive into the show.

686
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:08,640
Before we get into the news, I do just want to say.

687
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:19,240
So has anybody been watching this, um, Candace Owens, Erica Kirk saga on YouTube?

688
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:20,960
Where, where's everybody at with that?

689
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,040
I'm, I'm just curious.

690
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:24,160
I just want to take a poll.

691
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:27,240
Where is everybody at with the Candace Owens, Erica Kirk thing?

692
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:29,040
I want you to press one in the chat.

693
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:33,920
If your team Candace, I want you to press two of your team, Erica, I just want to take

694
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:38,120
the temperature because I don't really know where everybody's at.

695
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:43,920
I know the one Charlie Kirk got died or got died, which Charlie Kirk got assassinated.

696
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:49,040
Everybody was a conspiracy theorist, but now I kind of want to know how people are rocking

697
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,040
with this press.

698
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:54,320
One, if your team Candace, two, if your team, Erica, I'm just curious.

699
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:58,880
Kind of what the consensus is live chat's kind of moving.

700
01:32:58,880 --> 01:32:59,880
Oh, wow.

701
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:00,880
A lot of twos now.

702
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:01,880
A lot of twos actually.

703
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:02,880
Okay.

704
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:07,480
Some people saying three, well, that's not an option.

705
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:08,480
Okay.

706
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:11,680
It's either team one or the other.

707
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:12,680
Here's the thing.

708
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:14,180
Okay.

709
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:20,080
I remember when Charlie Kirk got assassinated and everybody jumped on the conspiracy bandwagon

710
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:23,120
and they all said it's a big conspiracy.

711
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:29,000
Everybody said it's a huge conspiracy and Israel's involved and, you know, I think that was

712
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:33,760
in retrospect, the high watermark of the JQ movement and it was really all downhill

713
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:37,320
from there and maybe rightfully so.

714
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:44,080
And I remember back then, I said, I'm willing to follow the facts wherever they lead.

715
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:49,040
If there is evidence that Israel is involved, obviously, I'm very interested in that and

716
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,400
I'm willing to examine it.

717
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:57,160
And if it checks out, it was verified, I'll talk about it on the show and I'll be front

718
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:58,160
center.

719
01:33:58,240 --> 01:33:59,440
I'll be on the front lines.

720
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:02,840
You know that I always have been for many, many years.

721
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:08,280
I've been on the front line on this issue, but at that time, I was just unconvinced.

722
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:10,480
I never saw anything resembling evidence.

723
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:12,800
I didn't see a smoking gun.

724
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:17,520
As a matter of fact, all the evidence that we have points to Tyler Robinson.

725
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,240
Now you can criticize the evidence.

726
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:23,800
You can scrutinize the evidence, but we have evidence.

727
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,200
We have discord logs.

728
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,640
We have the murder weapon.

729
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:30,440
We have security camera footage.

730
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:32,840
He turned himself in.

731
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:37,480
So you know, we have all this stuff and all of it points towards him.

732
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:43,320
Now you can sit there and critique that and you can say that maybe it's all fake, but

733
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:46,680
where's the evidence that something else happened?

734
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:52,400
And I'm not talking about, oh, well, this doesn't quite make sense or how could a bullet

735
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:53,400
do this?

736
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:54,640
I mean, where's the hard evidence?

737
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:57,620
Where's the positive evidence forensic evidence?

738
01:34:57,620 --> 01:34:59,100
Where is it?

739
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:02,060
And I was patient and I entertained this.

740
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:07,180
Well here we are in February and it's like, there's nothing there.

741
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:11,060
Six months almost and nothing has turned up.

742
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:13,140
We don't have another murder weapon.

743
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:15,220
We don't have any witnesses.

744
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:17,340
We don't have any whistleblowers.

745
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:18,740
You got a big nothing.

746
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:22,580
And as a matter of fact, all the things that were claimed have kind of been debunked

747
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:24,060
at this point.

748
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:28,620
The Bill Akman retreat debunked with text messages and receipts.

749
01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:34,460
The Netanyahu letter that was supposed to have been misrepresented what we saw.

750
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:36,260
And Charlie was glazing Israel in it.

751
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:40,220
It's exactly what Netanyahu represented.

752
01:35:40,220 --> 01:35:45,740
And the Egyptian planes, the fork, Wachachuka, we got alibis from the fort and the Egyptian

753
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:48,780
planes, she got the data wrong.

754
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:53,180
So not only is there nothing, but all the leads have gone nowhere.

755
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:58,900
All the leads have either been refuted, debunked or they end in a dead end.

756
01:35:58,900 --> 01:35:59,980
Now we're on error.

757
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,920
Kirk. And I'll admit, I tuned into the first episode and I watched some of it. I saw some

758
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:11,600
of the clips and I saw some of the clips from today. And now the big idea, she's into the big idea

759
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:17,760
that Erica Kirk is some kind of handler. I don't even really know what the idea is actually,

760
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:22,160
because it's never been made clear. We don't, at this point, we still don't even know what the

761
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:28,080
theory is who killed Charlie Kirk or why. There's all these little things like psychics and time

762
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:34,960
travel and the French and the Israelis and Freud somehow and like, I don't even really know

763
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:41,680
what the big idea is is that she's like some kind of military spook. I don't even really know what

764
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:48,480
the big idea is. But okay, let's entertain the idea that maybe she's involved in this. What's the

765
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:55,680
evidence? And I'm watching the show and the evidence amounts to these like clerical errors.

766
01:36:56,080 --> 01:37:01,680
So we looked into these divorce records and it, they had the wrong year for her marriage and

767
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:11,760
divorce in one of the filings. And he go, okay, so what? The parents got divorced and in the

768
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:21,200
filing that year is wrong? Okay, so what? If your claim is that she's some kind of military plant

769
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:28,640
and Charlie's a psychic and he can astral project and the military shut it down because they're

770
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:37,360
into magic and the fusion of science and spirituality. How does that prove any of that? How does a

771
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:45,520
how does a miss or I don't know what you would call that? I mean a false entry, a mistake. How does

772
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:52,480
a mistake on a public court filing prove that Charlie Kirk was a psychic and had ESP

773
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:58,800
and was killed by them? I'm just not seeing it. So I saw that today and I was very disappointed

774
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:04,400
because there was so much hype. It's like, okay, we're going to blow the lid French kill squads

775
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:11,600
and time travelers and astral projection and psychics and aliens and this is a conspiracy that

776
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:19,600
goes back 300 years and you go, okay, let's see. So let's get into it. Let's get down to business.

777
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:26,000
What's the proof? So we went into her to parents divorce filings from 30 years ago and they got

778
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:34,800
the year wrong and they hastily edited it with pen. You go, okay, so so I saw that and I got to

779
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:41,200
be honest. This is what I will say. And it was a little bit surprising. Matt Walsh, who is

780
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:48,720
canisowans former colleague and friend at daily wire. He came out today with the video very strongly,

781
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:56,400
very directly going after canisowans for attacking Eric Kirk. And I watched the whole video and

782
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:03,520
credit words do. You know me, I'm very critical of Matt Walsh. I believe he should leave daily

783
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:08,800
wire. I think as long as he is at daily wire, he is giving them credibility. I think daily wire

784
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:17,360
is a Zionist Jewish operation. I think it effectively exists to support the pro-Israel agenda.

785
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:22,480
And I think that the longer that Matt Walsh and Michael Noel stay there, they are delaying

786
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:27,600
its inevitable collapse and they're actually buttressing its credibility. So I have my critiques

787
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:33,840
of Matt Walsh. But I have to say I really admired his statement today. And it's not just because

788
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:38,800
I have a little bit of a beef with canisowans. It's because I think that took a lot of balls and I

789
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:43,680
think it took a lot of integrity because I know that's his friend and I know that they've worked

790
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:49,760
together and I know that he probably has to expect that he'll get some backlash for this

791
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:55,200
that maybe his audience won't be receptive to it. But it was a very powerful episode because he

792
01:39:55,200 --> 01:40:01,360
said, you know what? At the end of the day, this isn't a game. He said, Charlie Kirk actually did

793
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:08,080
die. And Erica actually is now a widow. And you can take away everything else. And you know,

794
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:12,640
you can talk about the evidence and the killing and all this. He goes, but that's her life.

795
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:19,920
And she's devastated. She's a wreck. This is a horrible situation. How is somebody supposed to

796
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:24,240
react to a situation like that? Your husband gets publicly executed by some maniac.

797
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:31,360
He goes and he says he's talked to her and he's he's leveled with her and related with her.

798
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:38,720
He said, and fundamentally, it is just wrong to attack and accuse somebody with no evidence.

799
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:44,960
If you're going after somebody and he made actually a really good point, he said it better than

800
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:51,280
I did. He said, nobody is saying that Erica probably killed Charlie, but we should let it go

801
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:56,640
because he's a, she's a grieving widow. He goes, there's no evidence that she did this.

802
01:40:57,440 --> 01:41:01,760
And she is a grieving widow. And you're making all these unfounded charges and unfounded

803
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:06,800
allegations, which what they really amount to is sort of circumstantial stuff. It's a lot of

804
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:11,200
judgemental type stuff. Well, we don't like the way she looks and we don't like the way she's acting

805
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:16,960
questioning some of the decisions she's made. He goes and it's just wrong to level these

806
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:22,640
unfounded charges with no evidence against a person, especially when they're going through a

807
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:28,000
very difficult time and that's their life. And I thought that was a really powerful statement.

808
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:33,600
And you know, I've said some things about Erica Kirk too. And I think it's true. I mean,

809
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:40,240
she does look a little bit phony at times and I question whether it's a good idea for it to

810
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:44,880
take over turning point. And you know, I think those are fair criticisms, but to say she's part

811
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:50,160
of the military conspiracy to killer husband, where's the evidence? That requires extraordinary

812
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:56,720
evidence. And if you make that claim, the burden of proof is on you. We're innocent until proven

813
01:41:56,720 --> 01:42:01,520
guilty. If you're making the claim, we're not saying that turning point is 100%. You know, me,

814
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:06,400
I've had my problems with turning point. And we're not saying that we totally approve of that

815
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:12,560
decision for her to step up or whatever. But you're making the claim that she killed her husband

816
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:18,720
that she saw military spook. That's an extraordinary allegation. It does require evidence.

817
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:23,280
The burden of proof is on you. And so far, there's none of that. And what we get instead is a sort of

818
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:31,280
smarmy cocky attitude and also always talking about the numbers. It's always like, well, you're just

819
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:36,000
mad because my show's number one. You're just mad because our show's doing so great. You're just

820
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:41,840
mad because we're making so much money. And he goes, where's the evidence? If you care about the

821
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:47,360
truth, you're a truth teller, why you run into this person through the ringer without any actual

822
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:52,960
credible evidence? When I talk about a person, for example, like JD Vance, I bring the receipts.

823
01:42:54,080 --> 01:43:00,480
He held the fundraiser at Les Wexner's house in Ohio, according to several sources. Les Wexner's

824
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:07,280
in the Epstein files. That's evidence. We talk about Tucker Carlson. You bring the receipts.

825
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:14,800
His dad ran voice of America for the CIA. Then was at the foundation for defensive democracies,

826
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:21,360
which is the most pro-Israel think tank in DC. That's evidence. That's a receipt. That's proof.

827
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:27,760
It's there. It's public record. It's, it's there. These associations,

828
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:34,480
these events, these are things that are documented. That's proof. But to say, we found a

829
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:40,560
clerical error in this public filing from 40 years ago and such and such a thing, Sigmund Freud,

830
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:47,200
and this dad and the other project looking glass. That's not evidence. And this is what I was

831
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:53,440
getting after out the year. It's just irresponsible and it's also unethical

832
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:59,920
to run a show like it's a soap opera. And this is my problem with the

833
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:08,320
conspiracy genre. It's being, it's being generated. As though it's a serialized true crime soap opera.

834
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:16,080
When in reality, well, what it should be is it should deal in reality. It should deal with facts.

835
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:20,560
It should deal with evidence. It should deal with the truth. We are in the business of seeking

836
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:27,760
the truth in politics, in religion. And if there's a conspiracy, then in a conspiracy theory as well.

837
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:35,520
But the purpose of the show is not to create this endless glut of sensationalist tabloid gossip

838
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:42,720
for women. Like it's a big game. It's not a game, but we are trying to achieve political change.

839
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:48,320
And we're in this pursuit of truth. So to do all of this, it's gone on long enough.

840
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:53,040
It has reached this point of, I think, just total exuberance.

841
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:58,720
And I actually commend Matt Walsh. I thought that was very admirable. And I think it speaks very

842
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:03,040
highly of his character. And it's a shame, you know, because I really, like I said, I've got a

843
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:08,160
lot of critiques of Matt Walsh. But time and again, I think he does demonstrate that he has character.

844
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:12,000
Even though I disagree with him, even though I really have intense

845
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:18,320
criticisms and disagreements with him and his decisions, I think he's, he's a guy with a lot of

846
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:23,040
integrity and a lot of character. And I think that he proves that time and again, you got to give

847
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:26,880
credit where it's due. You got to be, if someone's doing something wrong, you got to be critical.

848
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:32,240
If someone does the right thing, you have to be effusive in your praise also. So good on him.

849
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:36,320
But I just wanted to throw that out there. I'm witnessing this. And I'm like, you know, this

850
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:40,880
is wrong. This is just fucked up at this point. And I'm not trying to white night for turning point

851
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:48,480
at all. I know I just took a poll and said, are you on team Candace or team Erica? It's really not

852
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:55,120
about taking sides. I have my problems with turning point. I have my personal beef with Candace.

853
01:45:56,320 --> 01:46:01,360
But this is wrong. You want to go after turning point, go after them for the right reasons.

854
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:06,880
You know, my critique against turning point was that they were too pro-Israel, too pro legal

855
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:13,040
immigration, too socially liberal based on things they had said. I wasn't saying, oh,

856
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:17,760
they're killing their founder. They, they conspired to murder their boss and husband.

857
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:27,360
And we brought evidence, you know, so it's a shame. It's really, I feel like 2026 is a difficult

858
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:35,920
year. I've said it. 2025 was in many ways the high watermark. I think that everybody woke up and

859
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:41,440
this became a big fat and this became a big social media trend. And now we're sort of witnessing

860
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:50,400
the fragmentation. And I think it was because maybe this stuff became so popular that it attracted

861
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:58,080
the wrong kinds of people. And by that, I mean the Jewish conspiracy stuff, the general conspiracy

862
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:05,280
stuff, it became so sensational and so popular. It truly became a phenomenon that it attracted a lot

863
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:11,920
of people who were in it because it was an endless wellspring of engagement for engagement farming.

864
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:17,360
And then therefore translating that into money, advertising dollars, a media career, that was,

865
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:24,400
that was like the next, that was the second act for a lot of different kinds of media personalities.

866
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:29,280
And even with the audience, I think the audience was attracted to it because for whatever reason,

867
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:35,120
this was being pumped onto everybody's timeline, onto everybody's for you page by the algorithm.

868
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:41,600
And so as a consequence, maybe there was this bubble effect. There was too much of it,

869
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:47,840
too much of it. And maybe the wrong kinds of people creating and consuming it. And now I think we're

870
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:56,320
in a, you could say a JQ recession. We are certainly in what I would call a JQ correction. And there

871
01:47:56,320 --> 01:48:02,880
are some elements of that. It's in our conflict with the left that is Israel critical. It's in our

872
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:08,240
conflict with the Muslims that are preoccupied with the provincial concerns of their own people,

873
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:15,600
like Palestinian statehood. And it's in the skit so QAnon conspiracy stuff. I also don't doubt

874
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:25,840
that there is some element of foreign influence there. And obviously those charges are amplified

875
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:30,880
to suit the needs of the Israelis. They like to say, oh, well, every Israel critical thing is

876
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:36,320
result of foreign influence. I think we're just not being honest if we say that there wasn't any

877
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:41,680
element of that at all in the past year. And I think almost certainly you could say there was.

878
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:47,760
Now that is independent of the truth. The truth is the truth. But whether certain narratives

879
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:54,160
were artificially amplified, that is also a separate question. And it's testable. So

880
01:48:55,120 --> 01:49:00,560
we have to move very thoughtfully. Everything cannot be a purity spiral. Everything cannot be

881
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:07,360
heuristic thinking. And by that, I mean, we cannot fall back and be intellectually lazy on certain

882
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:13,040
heuristics where we just blame the Jews for everything. Oh, Charlie Kirk got killed. It's Israel.

883
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:18,320
Really? Why? Where's the evidence? Will they kill everyone else? Okay, that's a heuristic.

884
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:25,040
That's a rule that has been established. That's intellectually lazy. And and then the

885
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:31,600
ceaseless idea, everything is a conspiracy. And if you don't believe in every conspiracy,

886
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:36,080
well, you're not our guy. You're a fad. You're an operative. You're a part of the psychic

887
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:39,680
CIA illuminati thing. You're a frankest.

888
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:46,320
What we are in the business of, I'll remind you, is achieving political change. And this

889
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:52,560
requires us to be extremely thoughtful and sharp and clever and prudent. And so it can't

890
01:49:52,560 --> 01:50:00,320
always just be like I said, the lowest IQ loudest people in the room, the most unseasoned

891
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:09,280
people that got redpilled yesterday, the lunatics running the asylum. We have to be very careful

892
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:14,480
moving forward because this last thing I'll say, as we get into the show tonight, you will see

893
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:22,000
the Jews have mounted a counter offensive. Okay, they saw what happened last year.

894
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:27,280
And they went back to the workshop and they figured out their new response. And now I think

895
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:34,960
the momentum is with them more than it is with us. And so that requires us to be good game players.

896
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:43,040
That requires us to be good tacticians and strategists. We have actually an abundance of people

897
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:49,200
that are cheerleaders and yelling in a megaphone, chanting, chanting, the talking points. We actually

898
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:56,320
have enough of that. What we need are tacticians, strategists, people that can think strategically,

899
01:50:56,320 --> 01:51:01,600
people that can think critically. What we need are genuine researchers, people that are willing

900
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:05,680
to do the boring work of doing the real research and actually scrutinizing evidence,

901
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:11,040
not going through the Epstein files and doing command find. And saying, where do they mention the

902
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:16,800
satanic pedophile stuff? And then just literally throwing out everything that we find,

903
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:23,360
even if it's fake, even if it's debunked or AI generated, we have to do the difficult work.

904
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:29,360
We are in a war. War is difficult. Games are difficult because on the other side of the table

905
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:37,440
is another rational actor on the other side of the table from us on the chess board is a very

906
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:44,720
sophisticated adversary, okay? On the other side of the chess board is a very sophisticated,

907
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:52,320
rational actor, a very complex thinker. I'm talking about world jewelry. And so if you think we're

908
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:58,560
just going to scream in their faces with the pitchforks and torches until we magically somehow win,

909
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:01,440
we

910
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:05,720
just need more anger. Just say it louder. Just say it again. Just say the same thing every

911
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:11,000
day. Jews did it. Jews did it every day. And if we just say it loud enough, and if we

912
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:19,040
just say it obnoxiously enough, somehow that will magically give us institutional power.

913
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:29,680
No. The only success belongs to people that can engage in long term planning sustained

914
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:36,120
efforts, strategic and tactical thinking, people that are sophisticated, people that are

915
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:41,840
so reminded, looking at the truth, that is what delivers victory. And that's what I'm

916
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:46,880
interested in. I'm interested in freeing our people. I'm interested in American sovereignty.

917
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:50,760
And that comes from gaining institutional power. And that's not going to be achieved

918
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:56,680
by chest beating. But people genuinely seem to think that they think that if the goi

919
01:52:56,680 --> 01:53:01,320
and wake up, if the goi and wake up, and if we just do, we're going to do another rant,

920
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:05,040
we're going to do another rant on Twitter. We're just going to charge up our emotions,

921
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:10,640
more rage porn, more yelling. One day we'll wake up in the country that we want. No,

922
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:19,920
you have to build the country that you want brick by brick every day with painful sacrifices.

923
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:29,160
Don't you understand that? Painful sacrifices. And sometimes that's the pain of giving

924
01:53:29,160 --> 01:53:38,840
your life to this cause. Not looking for some orgyastic moment where we go out on the battlefield

925
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:44,280
and murder ourselves and get canceled because we say the most offensive thing. I mean, that

926
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:51,160
actually feels good to do that, to do something emotive. You know, it doesn't feel good.

927
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:57,440
Seventy years of sustained effort day in, day out, grinding it out in the trenches, in

928
01:53:57,440 --> 01:54:02,640
the battle, dirt on your face, getting shot at, not literally, maybe literally, but mostly

929
01:54:02,640 --> 01:54:10,120
figuratively dealing with the heartbreak and the frustrations that this uphill battle,

930
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:16,680
it feels like a scissor fee and struggle. That, that is what is required. And so, you

931
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:20,240
know, it's a good thing that everybody woke up last year. I'm not going to say it wasn't

932
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:27,480
a good thing, but we now need to filter and refine and shape and what we need are the soldiers.

933
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:31,400
We need the people that are going to rededicate themselves to this on a daily basis because

934
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:37,600
it's the truth because it's important because it matters. It's our lives. It's our country.

935
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:42,680
So anyway, that's just a word on that whole situation. I see that and I think, look at

936
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:48,080
how it's just gone so wrong, you know, with, with that. But I do want to move on. I want

937
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:52,840
to get into our featured story tonight, more on this whole situation and predicament that

938
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:58,880
we're in. Our featured story, we're going to talk a little bit about the update in Iran.

939
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:03,840
And I'm not going to spend too much time on this because I, I assume you're bored of

940
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:09,240
hearing about it. I don't know. I feel like we've been talking about this exact situation

941
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:16,040
for like three years now because I've been predicting this since October 7th. So for

942
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:20,560
me, it's like, I've been telling you this is going to happen. I feel like chicken little.

943
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:27,480
This guy is falling, you know, since October 7, 2023, it's now February, 2026. And it's

944
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:35,840
like, you know, day 700, you know, here we are. But look, there's a big development today.

945
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:41,720
So as we've been talking about all week, this morning was the third round of negotiations

946
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:48,840
between Iran and the United States on Iran's nuclear program. And going into this round

947
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:54,520
of talks, a lot of people had no idea what to expect because there's been some bizarre

948
01:55:54,600 --> 01:56:00,920
signals coming from the administration. I would say mixed signals. And this is another theme,

949
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:07,000
which has been present in this conversation for a long time, which is that the messaging is so

950
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:14,360
mixed. One day, you'll have the representatives from both sides saying the talks were great.

951
01:56:14,360 --> 01:56:19,080
They were constructive. We're making headway. We're talking again next week. It's all great.

952
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:25,160
But then the days go by and you hear the rumors from inside the White House and they say,

953
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:28,920
we haven't budged an inch. Our red line is the same. We're going to war.

954
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:34,440
So there's all these mixed messages, mixed signals coming from the administration.

955
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:41,400
And so everything was riding on this meeting this morning. Like I said, this is the third round

956
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:49,560
of negotiations and setting the stage. Two weeks ago, Trump began this massive military build-up

957
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:55,480
in the Middle East. I should say he started it a month ago, but this build-up started to accumulate

958
01:56:55,480 --> 01:57:01,800
about two weeks ago. And this is when Trump issued his ultimatum. Trump goes on true social and

959
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:07,720
says Iran is going to give up their nuclear program or we're going to destroy them. He said and

960
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:12,040
will give them a chance to talk, but we don't have a lot of patience. It's going to be a limited

961
01:57:12,040 --> 01:57:20,280
amount of time, not 60 days, maybe a few weeks. And over the past several weeks, you've seen two

962
01:57:20,280 --> 01:57:27,400
carrier strike groups deployed over a dozen warships, many squadrons of fighters, half of the

963
01:57:27,400 --> 01:57:34,760
deployable US air power is in the region. US soldiers are being removed from vulnerable military

964
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:41,240
sites. Defensive systems are being deployed and moved into the region. So we have been slowly

965
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:47,240
but surely preparing for war. As these talks have been underway, we have been making the preparations,

966
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:52,680
the offensive, the defensive capabilities, getting ready, locked and loaded so that if the talks

967
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:59,080
fall through, we can pull the trigger. Now again, the talks are concerning the nuclear program.

968
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:06,760
And as I've said, you may be sick of hearing it at the center of this conflict is whether Iran can

969
01:58:06,760 --> 01:58:13,400
enrich, can they enrich uranium? That's it. Because if they can enrich, they can make nuclear

970
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:18,760
fuel for a bomb. And on a long enough timeline, we have to assume they're going to do that.

971
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:25,480
So we have been insisting since 2018, when Trump ripped up the original nuclear deal,

972
01:58:25,480 --> 01:58:31,720
that Iran has to dismantle all of its enrichment facilities, they have to commit to

973
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:37,240
never enrich again. And the stuff they have enriched, they have to give it up. And if they can

974
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:42,680
agree to that, then we can integrate them in normalized relations and we can have peace.

975
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:50,600
Well, Iran is never agreeing to that. So this is the impasse. Now Trump said three weeks ago,

976
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:55,720
those are the demands. We're not playing around. We don't care about your missiles. We don't

977
01:58:55,720 --> 01:59:00,040
care about your proxies, but you have to give up enrichment. If you don't, there's going to be a war.

978
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:06,600
So we had the first round of negotiations. And these were held in Oman. They almost didn't

979
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:12,760
even happen. But our Middle Eastern allies, all the other ones convinced us that we should hear

980
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:18,280
Iran out. So we had our first round of negotiations in Oman a couple of weeks ago.

981
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:23,560
And all that was decided in those talks was a framework for future talks.

982
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:29,720
And the agreement was we're not going to talk about ballistic missiles or proxies

983
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:35,960
just the nuclear file. So then we come back the following week. And the United States tells

984
01:59:35,960 --> 01:59:43,080
Iran, this is last Tuesday, not Tuesday a few days ago, but about nine days ago in Switzerland.

985
01:59:43,080 --> 01:59:49,160
The United States tells Iran, these are our demands. No enrichment, give up your enriched

986
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:56,600
uranium, no sunset clauses, take it or leave it. And Iran said, well, maybe we'll give up some

987
01:59:56,600 --> 01:59:59,880
of this stuff. Iran said, well,

988
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:05,920
well, maybe we're going to give some concessions. Iran said, maybe we'll dilute some of our enriched

989
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:11,920
uranium. We're not giving it up. Maybe we'll give up half of it. Maybe we'll dilute it to a lower

990
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:17,360
percentage enrichment. They said, and maybe we'll stop enriching at a high level for a few years.

991
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:21,840
And the United States comes back and says, yeah, that's not where we are.

992
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:29,040
The US came back on Thursday and Friday of last week and said, this isn't really a negotiation.

993
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:35,440
They said, our position is over here. You're way out over there. They said, and you got to close

994
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:41,840
that gap. You got to meet us where we are or else. This is very important to understand. The US

995
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:48,160
is not budging. They're not offering creative solutions. It's not even a direct negotiation.

996
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:52,400
We are speaking through an intermediary through an Omani media, a mediator.

997
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:58,880
So the US says do better. Iran comes there. Here's where prepared to give up. And this is what we're

998
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:04,720
not prepared to give up. And the US says, yeah, still not, still not what we want. So they said, we'll

999
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:11,040
do another round of talks. And the United States tells Iran submit your proposal on Tuesday. We'll

1000
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:18,880
have our talks on Thursday. So the Omani representative delivered Iran's proposal. They sat on Thursday.

1001
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:26,160
And this is the development from this morning. Jared Kushner and Steve Whitkoff went to Switzerland.

1002
02:01:26,160 --> 02:01:32,720
I say, oh, man, they went to Switzerland this morning. And they told Iran, once again, these are our

1003
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:39,040
demands all over again. They said, we want zero enrichment. And as a matter of fact, you have to

1004
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:48,080
dismantle the facilities. You have to dismantle Fordo, Natanz, and Esfahan. And this is permanent.

1005
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:54,160
You can't reverse this. You can never go back on this. So no enrichment dismantled the facilities

1006
02:01:54,160 --> 02:02:01,920
forever. And they say that the stockpile of highly enriched uranium, you can't dilute it. You

1007
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:08,480
can't give it to Russia. You have to give all of it to us. Nobody else. These are our demands.

1008
02:02:09,120 --> 02:02:16,320
In exchange, we're going to give you some small sanctions relief. And all of that will be

1009
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:21,920
contingent on your compliance with the agreement. Iran rejected all those demands. This is a

1010
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:27,280
development this morning. So we came in and we said, this is our list of demands. Take them or leave

1011
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:34,640
them again. And Iran said, no, Iran literally rejected every single one. Iran said, we're going to

1012
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:39,920
enrich. We're not dismantling our facilities. Obviously, there's going to be no permanence because

1013
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:45,360
they aim to have continuity with the program. They said, we're not giving up our stockpile of enriched

1014
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:51,120
uranium. And they said, if you want to deal, we need massive sanctions relief immediately. Not

1015
02:02:51,120 --> 02:02:57,520
small sanctions relief over time. The United States walked away and said, even if Iran made a deal,

1016
02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:03,200
maybe the Ayatollah wouldn't even approve of it. And on the flip side, even if the United

1017
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:09,840
States made a deal, the US Senate might not approve of it. Any nuclear deal will have to

1018
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:15,120
ultimately be approved by the Supreme Leader on Iran's side. And the Supreme Leader does not trust

1019
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:21,520
the United States. If the president of Iran and the foreign minister are optimistic, the Ayatollah

1020
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:28,320
who is the sovereign, who is the head of state is not. So even if we had some capitulation from Iran,

1021
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:35,120
it's dubious that it would even stick. The reverse is also true. If the United States comes off

1022
02:03:35,120 --> 02:03:42,880
of our demands, it will have to be ratified by the Senate. Iran's entire problem with any kind of

1023
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:48,880
peace talks or nuclear talks is that if the United States ripped up the first deal, because it

1024
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:53,440
wasn't ratified, because the president was able to tear it up, how could they have confidence in

1025
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:58,560
another deal? Well, if there's going to be another deal, Iran is going to want it to be ratified.

1026
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:04,400
So that some other future president can't tear it up again. Well, who controls the Senate, the

1027
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:13,120
Republicans in particular, guys like Lindsey Graham and other Neocons, guys like Federman on the

1028
02:04:13,120 --> 02:04:18,160
other side that are in the pocket of Israel. And you're going to need 60 votes to get

1029
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:23,600
an Iran deal ratified. I don't know that you're going to be able to pull all those votes.

1030
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:26,800
Israel will pull the strings. If they don't like the deal, you're not going to have it.

1031
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:34,960
So here's the long story short. It's over. It's done. Okay, these negotiations are finished.

1032
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:39,520
They say there's going to be more talks. More talks next week. There's going to be more talks

1033
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:46,400
tonight. More talks tomorrow. Literally. They say the Omani representative is flying to DC to

1034
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:50,720
make a last ditch effort. And Trump is meeting with his people at three o'clock tomorrow. And there's

1035
02:04:50,720 --> 02:04:59,040
going to be more talks. What is there to talk about? The US demands have not changed since the

1036
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:06,320
beginning. And as of this morning, they haven't changed. And Iran has rejected them again as they

1037
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:12,000
always have. So what is there to talk about? What more can be said that will bridge a divide here?

1038
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:18,160
The most that Iran is offering is they'll dilute their stockpile, give up half of it.

1039
02:05:18,160 --> 02:05:22,160
As far as enrichment is concerned, they'll temporarily pause it, limit it.

1040
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:29,840
They say that maybe they can have a consortium that will enrich uranium in Iran for the Arab

1041
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:35,120
countries. The US isn't interested in any of this. And the US is not backing down.

1042
02:05:36,160 --> 02:05:42,480
So if there's not going to be a deal, if these positions are irreconcilable, then you can talk

1043
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:46,560
as much as you want. There's going to be no agreement. And if there's going to be no agreement,

1044
02:05:46,640 --> 02:05:49,600
well, what's the alternative? Trump is going to turn all the ships around.

1045
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:55,200
He's going to go to the two aircraft carriers and all these like Air Force wings. And he's

1046
02:05:55,200 --> 02:05:59,280
going to say, turn it all around. You know, we're good. We don't want to deal anyway.

1047
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:07,040
It's there. It's going to be used. We're going to war. So this is a story. This is from the Wall

1048
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:12,160
Street Journal. It says, quote, the latest round of talks over Iran's nuclear program wrapped up

1049
02:06:12,160 --> 02:06:17,200
on Thursday without a deal. And both sides are still far apart on key issues.

1050
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:22,720
US on voice, Steve Whitkoff and Jared Kushner said, Iran must destroy its three main nuclear

1051
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:27,920
sites, Fort O'Neill Tons and Eswan and deliver all of its remaining enriched uranium to the United

1052
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:34,400
States. They also said any nuclear deal must last forever and not sunset. Iran rejected the idea

1053
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:40,320
of transferring uranium stockpiles abroad. So that rules out giving it to Russia or the United

1054
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:46,800
States. It also has objected to ending enrichment, dismantling its facilities and permanent restrictions

1055
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:53,360
on its program. So they reject everything. Oman's foreign minister and a US official said the

1056
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:59,440
two sides made progress and will meet again. The Omani said negotiations at the level of

1057
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:05,600
technical experts will continue in Vienna next week. At least two dozen jet fighters crossed the

1058
02:07:05,600 --> 02:07:10,080
Atlantic Ocean from the United States, according to flight tracking data. They're expected to

1059
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:14,160
join several squadrons already positioned at bases across the Middle East and Europe.

1060
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:20,000
Iran has warned it would treat any attack, however limited as a trigger for an all-out response.

1061
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:28,560
Now, look, maybe you're tired of the technical talk here. The reason I'm bringing the technical

1062
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:33,680
stuff is because I want you to understand the state of the play and I want you to understand

1063
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:39,520
where this is going. Okay. It's easy to talk about what this is really about, which is obvious.

1064
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:46,560
But I just want you to know where we're going. Be that as it may. It should not be lost on

1065
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:56,560
anybody. Exactly what is going on here. This is as clear cut and as unambiguous of an example,

1066
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:59,840
as you can possibly find of a grand

1067
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Jewish conspiracy. And what I mean by this is that Iran is not our enemy. Does anybody

1068
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:14,000
seriously think it is in the interest of the United States of America to pursue another

1069
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:22,080
regime change war in the Middle East? How does that go for us? We just got out of Afghanistan.

1070
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:28,720
We just got out of Syria. We are aiming to get out of Iraq. This has just happened in recent

1071
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:35,920
years. What's the record there? Afghanistan belongs to the Taliban. Syria belongs to El Qaeda.

1072
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:42,480
Iraq doesn't even want us there. It's a fragmented country completely. Libya is a failed state.

1073
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:49,920
They still don't have a government. So what's the record of regime change? Failure. We're like

1074
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:56,320
oh and four on regime change. And not only that, it costs a ton of money. Americans die.

1075
02:08:57,200 --> 02:09:04,960
And you know, this stuff is also fungible, meaning everything that we use and lose in the Middle

1076
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:13,040
East. We can't use in the Indo-Pacific. We can't use in the Caribbean. So the United States does have

1077
02:09:13,040 --> 02:09:19,200
fights that are in our interest. And those fights will be for the first island chain. Those fights

1078
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:26,080
will be for the Caribbean and Latin America. But everything that we use and then lose all the money,

1079
02:09:26,080 --> 02:09:31,840
all the equipment, the lives, the morale, all of that that is buried in the Middle East with

1080
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:36,960
nothing to show for it. That is all opportunity cost that we're not going to be able to use in a

1081
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:44,320
future conflict that might actually benefit us. So this is an extraordinary liability who possibly

1082
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:50,560
would think that this is making America great again or putting America first or part of any kind

1083
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:58,960
of golden age. It isn't. Well, we were promised is rebuilding America, rebuilding American infrastructure,

1084
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:05,680
regime change in Washington. It doesn't matter who runs the Middle East. It doesn't matter who's

1085
02:10:05,680 --> 02:10:11,840
in charge of Iran. It matters who's in charge of the federal bureaucracy and the permanent state.

1086
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:20,560
Isn't that the entire conceit of MAGA is to take the entrenched elites out of the powerful

1087
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:27,680
positions and replace them with representatives of the people? And so who would think that in Trump's

1088
02:10:27,680 --> 02:10:33,840
second term, after his third run, after getting shot in the head, indicted all these things,

1089
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:42,480
he's taking us to war in Iran to die, to spend money, lose equipment for the Iranians right to

1090
02:10:43,360 --> 02:10:50,640
freedom, for the Iranians quality of life. And we all know the answer to this question. It's not

1091
02:10:50,640 --> 02:10:57,200
rhetorical. Do you want to know who thinks this is a good idea? Do you want to know who this is a

1092
02:10:57,200 --> 02:11:05,200
golden age for? For Israel, for the Jews. That is who has pushed us into this war. As a matter of

1093
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:10,720
fact, that's why we have the Trump administration. Why do you think Miriam Adelson gave Trump a

1094
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:16,560
hundred million dollars in this cycle? Why do you think she gave him a hundred million dollars

1095
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:23,360
in the first place in 2016? They have been paying the Republican Party this entire time

1096
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:31,280
to sabotage our relations with Iran, to rip up the original nuclear deal, to kill Qasim Soleimani,

1097
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:37,520
to bomb Iran's proxies, and ultimately in the long term to bring us to war, that is Iran's enemy.

1098
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:46,800
And understand what is happening here. When Iran's regime is toppled, Israel becomes the

1099
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:53,920
regional hegemon of the Middle East. Do you know what a valuable gift that is? Think about all

1100
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:59,760
the oil, all the natural gas. Think about all the money in the Middle East, all the money from

1101
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:05,680
their sale of oil. Think about all the trade routes. Think about all the sea routes going through the

1102
02:12:05,680 --> 02:12:11,760
Red Sea, going through the Persian Gulf. Think about all of the trade that happens in the Indian

1103
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:18,480
ocean in the Eastern Mediterranean. Think about all of the rail, the highways. Think about all the

1104
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:25,200
other utilities that run through the Middle East that are going to connect in the future, Asia,

1105
02:12:25,200 --> 02:12:32,160
Europe, and Africa. Israel is being handed that region on a silver platter. They will be

1106
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:38,160
speaking softly, carrying the big stick in the Middle East, running the show over there.

1107
02:12:38,560 --> 02:12:45,360
So who does this benefit? Not us. That's not our golden age. That's a golden age for them.

1108
02:12:46,400 --> 02:12:55,200
Our equipment, our lives, our money. It's our ass for their golden age to defeat their enemies

1109
02:12:55,200 --> 02:13:02,960
so that they can expand their territory. They can control more seas, more oceans, more land,

1110
02:13:03,680 --> 02:13:09,840
more trade routes. It literally doesn't get more simple than that. This has been their mission

1111
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:16,800
since October 7th and even before that. They said after October 7th, we're going to change the

1112
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:21,920
status quo in the Middle East that has prevailed for the last 50 years. What did you think they were

1113
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:28,240
talking about? They were talking about land for peace. They were talking about Camp David. They were

1114
02:13:28,240 --> 02:13:34,560
talking about the Islamic Revolution in 79. They were talking about Hezbollah in Lebanon.

1115
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:39,920
That is what they were referring to specifically at all these wars that have been fought. They said

1116
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:46,800
it's coming to an end. We are going to inaugurate our golden age. They said Trump is our Messiah. He's

1117
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:56,240
our Cyrus the Great. Trump is our pagan, goi leader who will defeat the Persians and deliver a

1118
02:13:56,240 --> 02:14:01,680
Jewish golden age. That's literally who it's for and that's why Jewish billionaires paid for it.

1119
02:14:01,680 --> 02:14:07,600
That's why the Jewish media stood down and acquiesced to Trump's return to power.

1120
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:14,160
And that is why you have the Republicans in Congress saying what they're saying. Look at Mark

1121
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:20,960
Levin on Fox News. Mark Levin is on Fox News telling everybody you don't love America. If you don't

1122
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:31,120
want Americans to die for Israel in the Middle East, it benefits them. And I told you this was going

1123
02:14:31,120 --> 02:14:38,720
to happen. I said this in 2024. I said a vote for Trump is a vote for a war with Iran and think of

1124
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:46,560
how they tricked you. This is part of it. These Zionist Jews, they larp as right wing. That's what

1125
02:14:46,640 --> 02:14:55,920
that is. Stephen Miller is a larper. They're all larpers. Mark Levin is a larper. They draped

1126
02:14:55,920 --> 02:15:02,480
themselves in the American flag. They draped themselves in the Constitution. They hide behind

1127
02:15:02,480 --> 02:15:09,040
President Trump because they know he's popular and they do all of this so that they can wrap their

1128
02:15:09,040 --> 02:15:14,720
arm around your shoulder and say, Hey, we need to go to war with Iran. We are in business together.

1129
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:20,960
We're going to make a deal. Trump is our president. This is what they do. They tricked you.

1130
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:28,160
They told you in 24, you know, the Jews woke up after October 7th and we realized that DEI

1131
02:15:28,160 --> 02:15:33,840
isn't good. We realized censorship and the left are out of control. And that's why we now support

1132
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:42,800
Trump. And you fell for that Bill Ackman wrote a letter to Harvard, the Jewish Zionist billionaire,

1133
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:48,080
and said, I've seen the light. I've had an epiphany. The left has gone too far. He's a lifelong

1134
02:15:48,080 --> 02:15:54,960
liberal Democrat. He saw the light after October 7th, but people said, Oh, he's a Republican now.

1135
02:15:54,960 --> 02:16:06,160
No, he saw the Republican Party as a vehicle to deliver Israel's agenda.

1136
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,640
Same thing with the frat bro uprising.

1137
02:16:02,640 --> 02:16:06,840
Remember when everybody was protesting Israel on the campuses?

1138
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:10,520
And then this was rebranded as the frat bro uprising.

1139
02:16:10,520 --> 02:16:13,760
A bunch of Jewish students went out to beat the shit

1140
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:16,880
out of Americans that protested Israel.

1141
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:21,360
And people said those are the based frat bros rising up

1142
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:26,360
for America and stuff, for bacon and for vapor wave.

1143
02:16:26,920 --> 02:16:29,120
For vapor wave.

1144
02:16:29,120 --> 02:16:34,200
It's cool frat bros doing it for the 80s and aesthetics

1145
02:16:34,200 --> 02:16:36,200
and whatever.

1146
02:16:36,200 --> 02:16:37,400
And you fell for it.

1147
02:16:37,400 --> 02:16:40,000
And that's what the Trump campaign was about.

1148
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:45,080
Mass deportations, goal, the age, all these promises.

1149
02:16:45,080 --> 02:16:50,000
And what does it deliver a war for Israel in Iran right on schedule?

1150
02:16:51,720 --> 02:16:55,240
Year and a half ago, people said I just can't even imagine Trump

1151
02:16:55,240 --> 02:16:58,360
bringing us to war in Iran for regime change.

1152
02:16:58,360 --> 02:16:59,560
That's insane.

1153
02:16:59,560 --> 02:17:02,880
It's unimaginable.

1154
02:17:02,880 --> 02:17:04,560
And now it's inevitable.

1155
02:17:04,560 --> 02:17:08,440
Now it's unthinkable that we're not going to war.

1156
02:17:08,440 --> 02:17:12,280
And that is because of the coercive influence

1157
02:17:12,280 --> 02:17:16,920
of organized jewelry inside of our country, inside of our state

1158
02:17:16,920 --> 02:17:20,520
department, our national security council, our Pentagon,

1159
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:23,280
inside of our media, inside of the GOP,

1160
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:28,520
inside of our billionaire class, they are pushing us into a war.

1161
02:17:28,520 --> 02:17:29,600
This is the problem.

1162
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:32,600
They have to lose their power.

1163
02:17:32,600 --> 02:17:36,800
Somebody must be elected president running against this.

1164
02:17:36,800 --> 02:17:43,680
In 2028, you cannot vote for JD Vance, who is JD Vance's gung ho about this.

1165
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:47,280
He goes and makes a statement to the media yesterday

1166
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:49,240
and says Iran can have nuclear weapons.

1167
02:17:49,240 --> 02:17:51,360
And we think that they're making them.

1168
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:54,200
He said when he was selected to be the vice president,

1169
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:57,080
he says, we got a punch Iran really hard.

1170
02:17:57,080 --> 02:18:01,680
He went to the Quincy Institute and said, we got to let Israel take the gloves off

1171
02:18:01,680 --> 02:18:03,480
and fight Iran.

1172
02:18:03,480 --> 02:18:06,400
You think we can vote for this guy in 28?

1173
02:18:06,400 --> 02:18:08,200
No, this is the problem.

1174
02:18:08,200 --> 02:18:14,880
You need someone to run in 28 that is explicitly committed to disempowering these people.

1175
02:18:14,880 --> 02:18:19,600
Someone needs to run in 28 and say, what the hell happened?

1176
02:18:19,640 --> 02:18:23,520
We were promised a golden age and no new wars and peace.

1177
02:18:23,520 --> 02:18:27,040
And somehow we got a regime change war in Iran.

1178
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:28,760
I don't care how it happens.

1179
02:18:28,760 --> 02:18:31,760
I don't care how successful it is.

1180
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:35,880
We are tired of being a puppet of a much smaller country.

1181
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:39,120
We need a president who's going to root that out explicitly.

1182
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:42,040
That's what Trump was supposed to be.

1183
02:18:42,040 --> 02:18:43,040
And he flipped.

1184
02:18:44,800 --> 02:18:46,960
So that's the situation with Iran.

1185
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:49,640
I want to move on because it gets better.

1186
02:18:49,640 --> 02:18:52,040
The same day.

1187
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:55,960
The same day as the situation in Iran is unfolding.

1188
02:18:55,960 --> 02:19:01,600
We get the news that finally in the drama over who will acquire Warner Brothers,

1189
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:05,840
the major media conglomerate, we have learned that in the end,

1190
02:19:05,840 --> 02:19:10,440
the long shot bid placed by David Ellison's media company,

1191
02:19:10,440 --> 02:19:14,640
Skydance Paramount has now been accepted.

1192
02:19:14,640 --> 02:19:17,560
And the Larry Ellison family will now acquire,

1193
02:19:17,560 --> 02:19:21,760
in addition to TikTok, Skydance Paramount,

1194
02:19:21,760 --> 02:19:27,200
they will now also have Warner Brothers that other media conglomerate.

1195
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:33,000
And they will form a super media conglomerate

1196
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:38,320
under the influence of two pro-Israel Jewish Zionists.

1197
02:19:38,320 --> 02:19:41,560
And this is a story, this is from the Wall Street Journal.

1198
02:19:41,560 --> 02:19:47,440
It says, quote, Paramount Skydance emerged victorious in the bidding war for Warner Brothers.

1199
02:19:47,440 --> 02:19:51,680
After Netflix said it wouldn't match the David Ellison led companies latest offer

1200
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:54,320
for the iconic Hollywood property.

1201
02:19:54,320 --> 02:19:58,320
Netflix pulled the plug on its deal soon after the Warner Board of Directors

1202
02:19:58,320 --> 02:20:02,800
said it determined Paramount's $31 per share offer for the entire company

1203
02:20:02,800 --> 02:20:07,520
was superior to Netflix's bid for Warner's movie and television studios

1204
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:10,080
and HBO Max streaming service.

1205
02:20:10,080 --> 02:20:15,720
Depending regulatory approval, Paramount will own not only Warner Brothers and HBO,

1206
02:20:15,720 --> 02:20:22,280
but also popular cable networks, including CNN, TNT, TBS, and Food Network.

1207
02:20:22,280 --> 02:20:30,320
The development marks a stunning stunning come from behind win for Paramount.

1208
02:20:30,320 --> 02:20:36,160
Jews win again, a major of the Jews have won again.

1209
02:20:36,160 --> 02:20:39,640
Whoa, and no one could predict this.

1210
02:20:39,640 --> 02:20:42,200
That's why we play the game, right?

1211
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:43,200
It's it.

1212
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:44,800
It's a stunning.

1213
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:46,360
I'm shocked.

1214
02:20:46,360 --> 02:20:50,120
You mean to tell me Larry Ellison got his way?

1215
02:20:50,120 --> 02:20:55,960
Stunned, stunned, shocked, amazing.

1216
02:20:55,960 --> 02:21:00,600
It's a stunning come from behind victory for Paramount and the Ellison family

1217
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:05,720
whose overtures had previously been rebuffed at every turn by Warner Brothers.

1218
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:08,920
After multiple unsolicited bids from Paramount last year,

1219
02:21:08,920 --> 02:21:13,760
Warner opened a sale process that ended with Netflix as the winning suitor.

1220
02:21:13,760 --> 02:21:17,800
When Ellison's Skydance media acquired control of Paramount last August,

1221
02:21:17,800 --> 02:21:20,920
going after Warner became his top priority.

1222
02:21:20,920 --> 02:21:25,600
Paramount was seen as too small to compete against Disney Netflix and Amazon.

1223
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:29,680
At that time, Netflix was facing an uphill battle with the Justice Department,

1224
02:21:29,680 --> 02:21:32,720
which was reviewing the deal.

1225
02:21:32,720 --> 02:21:38,640
So for those that don't know, Larry Ellison is a Jewish billionaire.

1226
02:21:38,640 --> 02:21:42,200
One of the richest men in the world, I don't know where he stands currently,

1227
02:21:42,200 --> 02:21:44,320
but he's one of the top 10 richest men in the world.

1228
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:48,280
He's got a couple hundred billion dollar net worth.

1229
02:21:48,280 --> 02:21:52,920
It comes from his software company, tech company Oracle,

1230
02:21:52,920 --> 02:21:58,400
which he owns and which he is the chairman and CEO of the company.

1231
02:21:58,440 --> 02:22:04,640
And he is also a close personal friend of Benjamin Netanyahu, very close friends.

1232
02:22:04,640 --> 02:22:10,960
So close that Netanyahu brought his family to Ellison's private island to vacation.

1233
02:22:10,960 --> 02:22:16,800
And Netanyahu called up Larry Ellison to get him out of a political jam in Israel.

1234
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:21,760
Go figure the prime minister of Israel is under investigation by his own government.

1235
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:23,760
Who does he call the bail amount?

1236
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:27,320
An American Jewish billionaire Larry Ellison.

1237
02:22:27,360 --> 02:22:34,840
And said, Hey, Netanyahu said, I need the Jewish lawyer that Arnon Milchan is hiring.

1238
02:22:34,840 --> 02:22:38,240
Can you talk him out of letting that lawyer go so I can hire him?

1239
02:22:38,240 --> 02:22:41,480
And Larry Ellison said, say no more and made it happen.

1240
02:22:41,480 --> 02:22:43,640
This is the relationship.

1241
02:22:43,640 --> 02:22:46,360
Larry Ellison has given millions of dollars to the IDF.

1242
02:22:46,360 --> 02:22:50,040
He even offered Netanyahu a spot on Oracle's board.

1243
02:22:50,040 --> 02:22:53,880
So an American software giant that owns all your data.

1244
02:22:53,880 --> 02:22:56,040
Netanyahu would be on the board of that company,

1245
02:22:56,040 --> 02:22:58,360
at least Netanyahu turned it down.

1246
02:22:58,360 --> 02:23:00,680
So it was offered to him.

1247
02:23:00,680 --> 02:23:02,520
That's Larry Ellison.

1248
02:23:02,520 --> 02:23:08,280
Last year, his son, David, who has his own media company called Skydance,

1249
02:23:08,280 --> 02:23:13,640
they started a quest to create one of the biggest media conglomerates in the world.

1250
02:23:13,640 --> 02:23:18,360
So Larry's son, David, has this Skydance company.

1251
02:23:18,360 --> 02:23:23,880
He acquired paramount and that purchase was underwritten by his father, Larry.

1252
02:23:23,880 --> 02:23:27,480
So they formed this conglomerate, Skydance paramount.

1253
02:23:27,480 --> 02:23:34,200
And with that, they got CBS, CBS news, the paramount studio, paramount plus,

1254
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:37,080
the streaming service, among other things.

1255
02:23:37,080 --> 02:23:40,680
So now they're cooking, now they got a little media conglomerate.

1256
02:23:40,680 --> 02:23:43,560
This deal was finalized in August.

1257
02:23:43,560 --> 02:23:47,640
You might remember when they gained control of CBS news,

1258
02:23:47,640 --> 02:23:52,360
they bought out Barry Weiss from the free press for $150 million.

1259
02:23:52,360 --> 02:23:56,120
And then they made her the editor-in-chief of CBS news,

1260
02:23:56,120 --> 02:23:59,960
where they started to change their coverage of the Israel-

1261
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:07,360
a war and the Middle East in general. Barry Weiss also brought on a new news anchor, Tony

1262
02:24:07,360 --> 02:24:12,960
Dokepill, who is a pro-Israel Jew, who is involved in a controversy with Tana Hazee

1263
02:24:12,960 --> 02:24:20,800
Coates in 2024. That was the move that happened last year in 2025. Then they launched a bid

1264
02:24:20,800 --> 02:24:25,760
to acquire Warner Brothers. They wanted their media conglomerate to be even bigger. They

1265
02:24:25,760 --> 02:24:32,000
said, if we want to compete with Amazon Netflix, Apple, Disney, it's not enough to just have

1266
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:37,440
Paramount. Paramount is peanuts. They said, we need Warner Brothers. So they submitted a huge

1267
02:24:37,440 --> 02:24:47,200
offer to acquire Warner Brothers studios, Discovery Channel, HBO HBO Max, CNN, TNT, TBS, all

1268
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:53,120
these properties under the Warner Brothers conglomerate. Skydance Paramount made a huge offer for it.

1269
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:58,480
Warner Brothers receiving the offer then opened up the bidding process and they started accepting

1270
02:24:58,480 --> 02:25:03,840
bids from other companies. Netflix came in with the better deal and the board of Warner Brothers

1271
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:10,160
approved the deal. This happened in December. And so since December, Netflix was going forward to

1272
02:25:10,160 --> 02:25:17,280
acquire Warner Brothers and Skydance Paramount was out of luck. That is until the DOJ,

1273
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:24,720
the Department of Justice under Pam Bondi began to scrutinize this acquisition. And they started

1274
02:25:24,720 --> 02:25:31,200
to say maybe Netflix is engaging in anti-competitive practices and maybe Netflix is going to be too big

1275
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:37,840
if it has HBO Max and Warner Brothers. And so there was this idea that maybe the deal might not be

1276
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:43,360
approved by regulators, ultimately, that are controlled by the Trump administration.

1277
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:50,400
Skydance Paramount, the elephants were not to be deterred. So they came back with an offer

1278
02:25:50,400 --> 02:25:56,720
that Warner Brothers couldn't refuse. And last week, they offered a vastly superior offer, much more

1279
02:25:56,720 --> 02:26:02,320
money. And Warner Brothers is now taking the deal. They literally could not not accept the deal

1280
02:26:02,320 --> 02:26:08,160
because it's too much money. And so now you're going to have Warner Brothers Paramount and Skydance.

1281
02:26:08,480 --> 02:26:15,280
This is in addition to, and I mentioned this at the top of the show, Larry Ellison's acquisition

1282
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:23,280
of TikTok. You might remember that back in 2024, the US Congress banned TikTok from the United

1283
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:29,920
States unless its parent company bite dance sold the American side of the business to an American

1284
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:37,520
company. And under Biden in his last year in office, no such deal was able to happen. That is

1285
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:44,800
until Trump came into office and Trump brokered the sale of TikTok's US business to a newly created

1286
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:54,000
US entity. He did that last year. Under the terms of that deal, Larry Ellison's company Oracle

1287
02:26:54,000 --> 02:27:02,240
will receive a loan TikTok's proprietary algorithm. And they will be able to modify it for US

1288
02:27:02,240 --> 02:27:09,680
TikTok users. What's more, Oracle already controls all of TikTok users data in America.

1289
02:27:10,400 --> 02:27:17,600
And Oracle will become one of the largest shareholders in the newly created US TikTok entity.

1290
02:27:18,560 --> 02:27:23,360
So Larry Ellison is by far and away the most important player in TikTok. He's got the algorithm.

1291
02:27:23,360 --> 02:27:30,960
He's got the data. He's got the ownership. He's got the equity. So you've got Skydance, Paramount

1292
02:27:30,960 --> 02:27:38,160
Studio, CBS, CBS News, Paramount Plus. Now you've also got Warner Brothers, Warner Brothers Studio

1293
02:27:38,160 --> 02:27:49,440
Discovery Network, HBO HBO Max and CNN plus TikTok. All of that under Larry Ellison, the close

1294
02:27:49,440 --> 02:27:58,400
personal friend of Netanyahu. It has come to pass. The Jews are once again in control of the media.

1295
02:27:58,400 --> 02:28:06,560
Is that a hateful trope? Is that an anti-Semitic connard? It's just true. Larry Ellison and his son

1296
02:28:06,560 --> 02:28:12,640
are Jewish. They are clearly partisans for Israel, friends with Israel's head of state.

1297
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:20,800
And they have accumulated in the span of a year, one of the largest media conglomerates in the world.

1298
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:24,480
And they've already made editorial changes to make it more pro-Israel.

1299
02:28:25,440 --> 02:28:30,240
Literally, what do you call that other than Jewish media? That's what it is.

1300
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:36,640
And consider the following. Think about what has happened under this Trump administration.

1301
02:28:36,640 --> 02:28:41,840
Just take a survey. In addition to these developments, you might remember last year,

1302
02:28:42,400 --> 02:28:47,760
after the war broke out in Gaza, there were all these protests against Israel on the college

1303
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:54,480
campuses at UCLA, at Columbia, at University of Pennsylvania. And the Jews were really unhappy

1304
02:28:54,480 --> 02:28:59,440
about it. And they started talking about suing these universities under the civil rights law.

1305
02:29:00,160 --> 02:29:04,640
And they talked about how these universities are anti-Semitic and they tried to get the faculty

1306
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:13,600
fired. When Trump got elected, he used the Department of Education to withhold hundreds of millions

1307
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:18,800
of dollars from all the Ivy leagues, forced them to come to the table and negotiate.

1308
02:29:19,360 --> 02:29:26,240
Otherwise, they would go bankrupt and forced universities like Harvard and Princeton and Yale

1309
02:29:26,240 --> 02:29:31,120
to accept onerous restrictions on what they can teach in their Middle East Studies Department

1310
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:37,760
about Israel and which groups supporting Palestine are allowed on campus. And what kinds of things

1311
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:41,200
can be said during a protest like from the river to the sea and so on.

1312
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:47,360
So you think about like a sampling of things that have happened under Trump since October 7th

1313
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:54,720
in 23 and Trump getting an office in 25, the Jews have recaptured the Ivy leagues

1314
02:29:55,600 --> 02:30:00,000
where there was an insurrection against Israel. It has been put down using the force of the

1315
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:05,520
Department of Education where there was a revolt in the media, the media which is controlled by

1316
02:30:05,600 --> 02:30:12,480
the left and maybe arguably criticizing Israel in some ways. On TikTok, where pro-Palestine content

1317
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:18,240
was more viral than pro-Israel content, now that insurrection has been put down. The algorithm

1318
02:30:18,240 --> 02:30:25,520
is firmly under the control of Larry Ellison. The entire content creation industry has been

1319
02:30:25,520 --> 02:30:30,400
vertically integrated under the control of the Ellison family. And in the Middle East, where the

1320
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:37,120
actual war is going on, once again, situation is under control. Whereas Biden was depriving Israel

1321
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:43,440
of 2,000 pound bombs and he tried to deter Iran rather than bomb Iran, try to make a deal.

1322
02:30:43,440 --> 02:30:49,440
Now the United States is about to pursue regime chains there. So think about who's up in this

1323
02:30:49,440 --> 02:30:56,320
administration, the Jews have recaptured the Ivy leagues, the media, TikTok and the Middle East.

1324
02:30:56,400 --> 02:31:02,480
And in every way, shape and form, this has been helped along by the GOP, specifically by

1325
02:31:02,480 --> 02:31:08,320
the Trump administration, by the executive branch. They have used the full force of the federal

1326
02:31:08,320 --> 02:31:17,520
government. It's education money, it's DOJ civil rights enforcement, using its military,

1327
02:31:17,520 --> 02:31:25,280
using its regulatory enforcement, using using all of these things to further the institutional

1328
02:31:25,280 --> 02:31:31,200
capture of Jewish Zionists over America. There's even other examples I mentioned earlier,

1329
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:37,360
Ronald Lawter, the head of the World Jewish Congress, his son is now the nominee to chair the

1330
02:31:37,360 --> 02:31:44,960
federal reserve. At the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab has stepped down. He's been replaced by

1331
02:31:44,960 --> 02:31:53,360
Larry Fink, the Jewish head of BlackRock. Everywhere you look, there it is. And you think about on the

1332
02:31:53,360 --> 02:32:00,080
flip side, we're out here complaining about no mass deportations, no border wall, no terror,

1333
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:06,240
no middle class taxa, all these kinds of things. And in the meantime, there is a golden age,

1334
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:12,560
but it's happening for the Jewish nation. The Jewish nation is under. They are getting everything

1335
02:32:12,560 --> 02:32:19,040
they want and more. They are feeling pretty good. They have institutionally captured our elite

1336
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:24,160
institutions. They've got Harvard, they've got the cathedral, they've got the brains,

1337
02:32:24,160 --> 02:32:29,280
they've got the military, the state department, they've got the White House, the federal reserve,

1338
02:32:29,280 --> 02:32:34,640
the world economic forum, ed Davos, they've got the Middle East, they are happy campers.

1339
02:32:35,840 --> 02:32:41,360
Everything on their wish list, they've crossed it off in a year. And the voters,

1340
02:32:41,360 --> 02:32:46,880
the forgotten men and women, the people of America, the white citizens of Springfield, Ohio,

1341
02:32:46,880 --> 02:32:55,600
of Minneapolis, Minnesota, the besieged citizens of New York City, Chicago, LA, we're out of luck.

1342
02:32:56,560 --> 02:33:03,200
Border wall hasn't happened, mass deportations hasn't happened, national guard deployments hasn't

1343
02:33:03,200 --> 02:33:09,280
happened, middle class tax cut infrastructure bill not happening. And Trump's biggest supporters

1344
02:33:09,280 --> 02:33:16,160
are put in the position of making excuses. Well, you got to be reasonable. You got to be reasonable.

1345
02:33:16,160 --> 02:33:20,400
You can't build a wall in a day. You can't deport a million people in a year. You can't

1346
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:28,320
telling us, selling us, selling us to short end of the stick here that we're always pulling.

1347
02:33:28,320 --> 02:33:34,720
This is what I'm talking about. And at what point do you recognize that we are clearly the junior

1348
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:42,480
partner in this relationship? If the GOP is comprised of its Zionist controllers and donors and

1349
02:33:42,480 --> 02:33:48,960
handlers and its white voters, its white conservative Christian voters, who is in the superior

1350
02:33:48,960 --> 02:33:56,480
position, it is clearly the Jewish handlers. They are in the driver's seat. They get everything they

1351
02:33:56,480 --> 02:34:02,720
want, no matter how unreasonable. They get what they want when they want it quickly. And we are left

1352
02:34:02,720 --> 02:34:11,520
making excuses. We are left coping and seething. Well, a million people left on their own, a million

1353
02:34:11,520 --> 02:34:19,040
people massively self-deported. We are left doing these things. Whereas Shapiro and Levin and

1354
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:25,760
Custer and Lumer, they're happy. Whoa, regime change and Larry Ellison's media empire and

1355
02:34:25,760 --> 02:34:35,520
Barry Weiss at CBS and Harvard is banned anti-Semitism and lists for them. And in here's the here's

1356
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:43,840
the little trick that they play. They make you think that you are giving them the power.

1357
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:51,040
There's a sort of false humility where we, we stupid idiot white people say, well, I guess I

1358
02:34:51,040 --> 02:34:56,800
could tolerate Jews controlling our government if we get mass deportations. That's what people

1359
02:34:56,800 --> 02:35:04,480
are saying. Am I wrong? They're saying, well, it's worth it. If we could get mass deportations,

1360
02:35:04,480 --> 02:35:08,640
I'll tolerate some Jews in the administration. These are based Jews. These are Jews that

1361
02:35:08,640 --> 02:35:15,040
agree with us. Howard lot and Jared Kushner, Steven Miller, Steve Whitkoff. They're trying to help us.

1362
02:35:15,040 --> 02:35:19,760
They're conservative. They're based. They're the good ones. I don't mind teaming up with them as

1363
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:28,480
long as we get mass deportations. And you think you are using them. You think that you are using

1364
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:34,640
them for your ends. Oh, we'll give them the poultry concessions. If we get what we want,

1365
02:35:34,640 --> 02:35:42,720
we'll reluctantly make that deal. But it is the reverse. They are using you. They are using your

1366
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:48,480
vote. They are getting you excited. They are getting you riled up about deportations and Somali

1367
02:35:48,480 --> 02:35:54,560
and fraudsters all this. They're whipping you up into a frenzy so that you will give them the

1368
02:35:54,560 --> 02:35:59,520
political support to do the thing they actually want to do. They don't give a shit about tariffs.

1369
02:35:59,520 --> 02:36:04,400
They don't care about mass deportations. You think they want America to be a white country?

1370
02:36:04,400 --> 02:36:10,400
They don't care. They go to a Jewish country club. They don't care. They just want to trick the

1371
02:36:10,400 --> 02:36:16,640
robes into thinking they're getting a nativist administration so that they can hire all of their

1372
02:36:16,640 --> 02:36:22,800
people in the positions that actually matter and do the favors for themselves. Give the patronage

1373
02:36:22,880 --> 02:36:26,960
to their own people. They can secure the ascendancy of their own tribe.

1374
02:36:29,680 --> 02:36:33,440
And how many times do we have to go over this? How many times do we have to learn that lesson?

1375
02:36:33,440 --> 02:36:38,960
People say, well, what's the alternative? The alternative is that we use our power.

1376
02:36:39,760 --> 02:36:46,240
The alternative is that we tell the GOP, if the GOP wants to succeed as an institution,

1377
02:36:46,240 --> 02:36:52,960
it has to be what it says it is. The GOP will die if it doesn't become America first.

1378
02:36:52,960 --> 02:36:57,840
We have to literally put a gun to the head of the GOP. I'm not fucking around.

1379
02:36:58,640 --> 02:37:04,560
Okay. That's how it has to be. What other option do we have? We've tried everything else.

1380
02:37:05,280 --> 02:37:11,280
You need to figuratively put a gun to the head of the GOP and say, give us the party or else.

1381
02:37:11,280 --> 02:37:18,480
This is a takeover. This is a hostile takeover. This is a hostage situation. Give us our party

1382
02:37:18,480 --> 02:37:24,800
or you fucking die. Metaphorically, metaphorically, politically. I'm not insinuating violence,

1383
02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:34,480
but that is we need a coup of the Republican party. We need a palace coup. We need to, again,

1384
02:37:34,480 --> 02:37:40,400
metaphorically, this is what I say every night. We need the young men that are watching this show

1385
02:37:40,400 --> 02:37:45,760
to join the ranks of the party, go to your college Republicans, go to your young Republicans,

1386
02:37:46,480 --> 02:37:51,680
be an intern, go on a campaign, volunteer in the administration, build up your resume.

1387
02:37:52,960 --> 02:37:59,360
This is like we are storming the palace, storming the palace, raising up the army. We are

1388
02:37:59,360 --> 02:38:06,400
raising up the militia figuratively and we're telling them, listen, your reign is over. You got

1389
02:38:06,400 --> 02:38:12,240
two options. The GOP will be destroyed or it's going to be America first. End of list.

1390
02:38:13,600 --> 02:38:18,160
There's no third option where we vote for the lesser of two evils. That's not happening.

1391
02:38:18,960 --> 02:38:24,240
There's no other option where we get reasonable and you talk us in off the ledge and we say,

1392
02:38:24,240 --> 02:38:28,640
oh, yeah, I guess we are a little hasty. You know what? We should just give you a vote one more time.

1393
02:38:28,640 --> 02:38:33,200
I think they're going to do it this time. It's happened every single time that way.

1394
02:38:33,840 --> 02:38:38,080
And you want to know where I'm getting this playbook from? It's coming from Trump himself.

1395
02:38:39,440 --> 02:38:45,760
In 2016, you know what Trump said? He said, if I don't win the GOP nomination, I'll run as an

1396
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:53,200
independent. And they said, but Mr. Trump, if you run as an independent, surely Hillary Clinton will

1397
02:38:53,200 --> 02:38:58,640
win. And you know what? Trump said, yeah, but I got a lot of leverage. So I want to run as the

1398
02:38:58,640 --> 02:39:06,720
Republican. And if not, maybe I'll run as an independent. Don't tell me this is some crazy idea.

1399
02:39:06,720 --> 02:39:11,200
Don't tell me this has never been tried before. That was the foundation of this movement.

1400
02:39:12,320 --> 02:39:18,240
And let's not pretend like they gave it to Trump. Trump did what I'm talking about doing in 28

1401
02:39:18,240 --> 02:39:27,120
in 2016. The GOP tried everything to cheat him, deny him. They tried everything to stop him.

1402
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:32,640
And in the end, many of them didn't even vote for Trump. Ben Shapiro didn't vote for Trump in 16.

1403
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:39,440
Neither did JD Vance. Neither did many of them. They were perfectly willing to let a Democrat win in

1404
02:39:39,440 --> 02:39:47,120
2016. They were never Trumpers. Don't forget that. They were ready to roll eight years of Obama

1405
02:39:47,120 --> 02:39:51,040
into eight years of Hillary Clinton. And they said, well, we'll just suck it up.

1406
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:59,760
And now those same people tell us you can never do that. You can never vote for a Democrat. You can never...

1407
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:06,720
not vote for the Republican. You have to vote Republican. The alternative is catastrophic.

1408
02:40:06,720 --> 02:40:12,160
Really? Well, where was that energy in 2016? Before you knew the Trump was a shabba's

1409
02:40:12,160 --> 02:40:17,120
goi, you were willing to let Hillary Clinton win. How is that any different? How is it any

1410
02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:24,400
different that the never Trumpers were pleased? They were satisfied and smug knowing that they might

1411
02:40:24,400 --> 02:40:30,640
guarantee the election of Hillary Clinton and they were fine with that. But now you suggest we

1412
02:40:30,640 --> 02:40:36,000
sit this one out because we're getting a war with Iran and no mass deportations and people try

1413
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:41,840
to tell you, you're a Democrat, you're a plant, something like that. They're gaslighting you.

1414
02:40:42,800 --> 02:40:46,320
They're gaslighting you because they don't want you to have what you're entitled to.

1415
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:54,080
So you want to translate this mass awakening into political success. It starts with saying,

1416
02:40:54,080 --> 02:41:03,680
no, it starts with saying no to an administration that does nothing for you. It doesn't care about you,

1417
02:41:03,680 --> 02:41:11,360
it doesn't even like you. As a matter of fact, it wants you dead. You are worthless to these people.

1418
02:41:11,360 --> 02:41:17,920
Larry Fink, Howard Lotteneg, Jared Kushner, Stephen Miller, these white people that worship Stephen

1419
02:41:17,920 --> 02:41:23,600
Miller, he looks at you like a bunch of goi, because it's what you fucking are. He looks at you like

1420
02:41:23,600 --> 02:41:30,080
a bunch of stupid goi that are going to empower him and his friends so they can have their war for

1421
02:41:30,080 --> 02:41:38,960
Israel. And that is his MO. So it starts with saying no, I'm not going to vote for the Iran war

1422
02:41:38,960 --> 02:41:45,360
candidate. I'm not voting for the Larry Ellison candidate. I'm not voting for the Alan Garber

1423
02:41:45,360 --> 02:41:52,080
candidate and the Kevin Worsh candidate. I'm voting for someone who's America first. I don't care

1424
02:41:52,080 --> 02:41:59,040
who it is. I'm voting for the guy that's going to say America first. And I won't vote for anything

1425
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:08,640
less at all. They say lesser of two evils. Who gives a ship? They wanted to let Hillary Clinton win.

1426
02:42:08,640 --> 02:42:15,360
We would have been fine then. We'll be fine now. So that's the message of the show. But we're

1427
02:42:15,360 --> 02:42:19,040
going to move on. We're going to take a look at our super chats. We'll see what you guys have to

1428
02:42:19,040 --> 02:42:33,040
say about all this. Let's take a look. That's my go off for the night. But seriously, like how do

1429
02:42:33,040 --> 02:42:42,160
you not recognize it? How do you not? Everything I just said is a fact. What is this administration done

1430
02:42:42,160 --> 02:42:47,520
other than secure the ascendancy of Jewish elites? Nothing. Nothing.

1431
02:42:49,520 --> 02:42:55,760
Here's your little, here's your little party favors going. It's ridiculous. Wake me up when

1432
02:42:55,760 --> 02:43:00,480
Springfield gets liberated. Are we still even, they don't even talk about it anymore because they

1433
02:43:00,480 --> 02:43:06,320
got your vote. They got your votes and now they're done talking about it. All right, we're going to

1434
02:43:06,480 --> 02:43:12,320
move on. Let's see. Let's take a look. Let's see what you guys got going on here. Let's see.

1435
02:43:12,320 --> 02:43:15,840
Classic Big B percent $20. Huge support from the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Thanks for your hard work.

1436
02:43:16,960 --> 02:43:23,120
Hey, thanks a lot, man. I appreciate it. Never been up there. I guess I've been a national harbor.

1437
02:43:23,120 --> 02:43:26,480
Is that the Eastern Shore? I don't know. Get them goblins and $20. Just finish reading River of

1438
02:43:26,480 --> 02:43:32,000
Darkness by Buddy Levy, Pizarro and Doray on a top tier wangs. I don't know that one. JJ's

1439
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:36,800
accent $25. What's up? Just wanted to send a super chat. Have a good night. Peach emoji. Thank you.

1440
02:43:36,800 --> 02:43:40,480
Appreciate it. Based Wang sent $20. Hey, Nick, if we attack Iran, I'll unfortunately have to go.

1441
02:43:40,480 --> 02:43:44,320
Not to be gay or anything, but I've written you in my will for 25% of all my money. Talk about loyalty.

1442
02:43:44,320 --> 02:43:48,320
It's to the grave. My nigga saluting face emoji. What does that mean? You're going to be in the war?

1443
02:43:50,240 --> 02:43:55,520
I don't, I don't know what you mean by that. But listen, I disavow all violence. I disavow all political

1444
02:43:55,520 --> 02:44:00,400
violence. Okay. I don't know what you mean by that. Kind of free. That I think describes the

1445
02:44:00,400 --> 02:44:03,520
low and Q anti-Semites who fed issues with the numerous and very legion of dollars of half-animated

1446
02:44:03,520 --> 02:44:07,200
portions conceded, half-educated coxcoms who attach themselves to the idea most in fashion only to

1447
02:44:07,200 --> 02:44:12,160
vulgarize it and who character you're every cause they serve. However, sincerely. Yeah, that's kind of

1448
02:44:12,160 --> 02:44:20,640
accurate. I guess we've been dealing with that problem for a long time. I guess there's really

1449
02:44:20,640 --> 02:44:26,880
nothing new under the sun, huh? Attached themselves to the idea most in fashion only to vulgarize it

1450
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:33,360
caricature every cost they serve. That's, yeah, that is pretty on the nose. That's looks maxing

1451
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:37,040
in cell dumb. That's this. That's very.

1452
02:44:37,040 --> 02:44:39,280
$20. Erica is actually Charlie Kirkstead confirmed.

1453
02:44:42,160 --> 02:44:49,680
That's crazy. Yeah. Charlie Gerg was married to his dad just like a manual macron. I'm shocked

1454
02:44:49,680 --> 02:44:52,720
that it went there. See, or grow a percent. $20. I have to tell my word for it, but I'll run

1455
02:44:52,720 --> 02:44:56,080
Hubbard reincarnating as a semi-literate black woman is on my 2026 bingo card. All I need is

1456
02:44:56,080 --> 02:44:58,320
Paul Town intentionally triggers the singularity and I win a set of stick knives.

1457
02:44:59,760 --> 02:45:03,840
Okay, I think it's $25. Rape and pray for sniko. No, it doesn't matter as long as it gets done.

1458
02:45:03,840 --> 02:45:11,360
Come on now. No, we're just pray. We love sniko, but it's these Muslims, man. He called me a

1459
02:45:11,360 --> 02:45:19,600
larper. Me a larper. He goes, you're not a Roman. Your name is Fentus brother. My mom's line is

1460
02:45:19,600 --> 02:45:26,320
from Italy. Where do you think Rome is? Hello, my mom's line. My mom's a hundred percent Italian.

1461
02:45:26,320 --> 02:45:31,600
I'm literally Roman. You on the other hand, think you're Malcolm X.

1462
02:45:33,120 --> 02:45:39,280
Can we just say that? You look Asian and you think you're Malcolm X. You want to talk about

1463
02:45:39,280 --> 02:45:46,320
larping? I don't use that word with me. Do not use that word with me. Did you just say larper?

1464
02:45:47,200 --> 02:45:51,920
I know you didn't just say larper. Don't use that word with me. Bro thinks he's Malcolm X.

1465
02:45:51,920 --> 02:45:59,360
Dude, you're not even African American. You are Haitian. You are a toy. You are Haitian.

1466
02:45:59,360 --> 02:46:04,720
Do you think you're Malcolm X? You are not a African American. You're like Obama. You're like

1467
02:46:04,720 --> 02:46:13,920
Barack Obama. Bro, half white, half non white and not even black, black, but like, you know,

1468
02:46:14,480 --> 02:46:19,520
global citizen black. You're like you and black. You're like a fucking world baby. You're a

1469
02:46:19,520 --> 02:46:24,080
United Nations baby. Little bit of Filipino, little bit of Haitian, little bit of this,

1470
02:46:24,080 --> 02:46:29,280
little little bit of Hungarian Jew. I'm the larper. You think you're Malcolm X with the whole

1471
02:46:29,280 --> 02:46:38,160
costume and everything. That's crazy. Now I am right. And by the way, Spain, Roman. Hello,

1472
02:46:38,160 --> 02:46:46,880
Spain, Italy, Roman. So that's crazy. Don't don't use that. Don't use that word with me.

1473
02:46:46,880 --> 02:46:51,840
You take off your throw before you call me a larper. You put down the Zamzam and you take off

1474
02:46:51,840 --> 02:46:57,840
the throw and your Malcolm X glasses that then you can call me a larper. Don't use that word with

1475
02:46:57,840 --> 02:47:05,360
me. I say that affectionately. I like the man. I like the Malcolm X larp. But I saw that I was

1476
02:47:05,360 --> 02:47:12,560
like, are you kidding me? Okay. So we're really doing this. We have to open up a can of whoop ass

1477
02:47:12,560 --> 02:47:23,280
on sneaker. We're really doing this. Hold my wig. Hold my, what's his, what's his name?

1478
02:47:24,640 --> 02:47:33,760
Anthropomorphic. What the fuck is his name? Anthrogenic. Hold my anthropogenic wig.

1479
02:47:35,760 --> 02:47:40,480
Gonna have to throw the fuck down with this nigga. Now we love sneaker. We like it. It's all love.

1480
02:47:40,480 --> 02:47:49,360
It's all love. But larp. Don't use that word with me, pal. Those who live in glass houses.

1481
02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:57,040
I like, I like the lot. $0.90. I think it's char. No, no, come on. George sent $30. Iran taco.

1482
02:47:58,800 --> 02:47:59,840
I think we're gonna get it.

1483
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:00,840
but we'll see.

1484
02:48:00,840 --> 02:48:01,680
Nephite won cent $20.

1485
02:48:01,680 --> 02:48:03,520
Syphazmox, the high post-added union yet he believes God

1486
02:48:03,520 --> 02:48:05,480
in his being has literal hands, feet, and a shin.

1487
02:48:05,480 --> 02:48:07,160
These solopheed, it's thinkmenolitary of a sky giant

1488
02:48:07,160 --> 02:48:08,080
counts his monotheism.

1489
02:48:09,480 --> 02:48:10,640
Yeah.

1490
02:48:10,640 --> 02:48:12,320
Well, their religion is crazy.

1491
02:48:12,320 --> 02:48:16,520
I mean, you know what they believe about Jesus?

1492
02:48:16,520 --> 02:48:20,680
They believe that Jesus, well, first of all,

1493
02:48:20,680 --> 02:48:23,480
why do they think that he was sentenced to death?

1494
02:48:26,200 --> 02:48:28,680
Muslims claim Jesus never claimed to be God.

1495
02:48:28,680 --> 02:48:30,720
Okay, so if he never claimed to be God,

1496
02:48:30,720 --> 02:48:33,240
why was he sentenced to death by the Jews?

1497
02:48:35,080 --> 02:48:39,440
Then they say, oh, well, you know, the gospel is revealed

1498
02:48:39,440 --> 02:48:42,720
and Jesus is the Messiah and a prophet and everything.

1499
02:48:42,720 --> 02:48:44,600
They say, but he never claimed to be God.

1500
02:48:44,600 --> 02:48:46,120
Okay, why do you get sent as death?

1501
02:48:46,120 --> 02:48:47,120
Oh, I don't know.

1502
02:48:47,120 --> 02:48:49,800
Okay, they say that when he was crucified,

1503
02:48:49,800 --> 02:48:51,800
do you know they believe that at the last minute

1504
02:48:51,800 --> 02:48:54,760
a body double was crucified instead?

1505
02:48:54,760 --> 02:48:56,280
A body double.

1506
02:48:56,280 --> 02:48:58,280
It's the Candacellans religion.

1507
02:48:58,320 --> 02:49:00,040
They believe that at the last minute,

1508
02:49:00,040 --> 02:49:02,600
Jesus was rescued from the cross,

1509
02:49:02,600 --> 02:49:05,200
ascended into heaven without dying

1510
02:49:05,200 --> 02:49:08,280
and a body double was killed, a body to,

1511
02:49:08,280 --> 02:49:09,600
so how do you do that?

1512
02:49:11,040 --> 02:49:13,760
How do you get a, and what's funny about this

1513
02:49:13,760 --> 02:49:17,000
is they've literally inverted the Jesus story,

1514
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:22,000
which is that Jesus arrives to die for our sins,

1515
02:49:22,760 --> 02:49:27,320
to atone for us and that shows God's self giving love

1516
02:49:27,320 --> 02:49:30,880
and hence the Trinity, the eternal overflowing,

1517
02:49:30,880 --> 02:49:33,280
self giving love of the Father to the Son

1518
02:49:34,320 --> 02:49:37,320
and which is symbolized in the crucifixion of Christ,

1519
02:49:37,320 --> 02:49:40,640
giving His Son for us, they flipped it on its head.

1520
02:49:40,640 --> 02:49:43,320
No, no, Jesus said, see you later.

1521
02:49:44,320 --> 02:49:47,680
Jesus said, they expect one of us in the wreckage brother

1522
02:49:47,680 --> 02:49:50,480
and he literally had someone else die in his place.

1523
02:49:50,480 --> 02:49:53,880
So, and how does that even make any sense?

1524
02:49:53,880 --> 02:49:54,720
They say.

1525
02:49:57,800 --> 02:50:00,240
So it's like on the level of Mormonism.

1526
02:50:00,240 --> 02:50:05,240
It's just totally unserious and it's ridiculous.

1527
02:50:05,240 --> 02:50:09,120
And Sonny Faz, dude, it's gonna be glorious.

1528
02:50:09,120 --> 02:50:13,520
It's gonna be glorious when he is captured by ISIS.

1529
02:50:13,520 --> 02:50:14,360
I'm kidding.

1530
02:50:14,360 --> 02:50:16,360
Okay, he got really freaked out by that.

1531
02:50:16,360 --> 02:50:18,880
The other day I said, I hope they chop off his head.

1532
02:50:18,880 --> 02:50:21,480
I said, I hope they go like Jamal Kashoggi on him

1533
02:50:21,480 --> 02:50:23,960
and he was like, I can't believe he said that.

1534
02:50:23,960 --> 02:50:25,200
It's jokes, buddy.

1535
02:50:25,200 --> 02:50:26,160
I'm just kidding.

1536
02:50:26,160 --> 02:50:29,080
Okay, pal, because that's what Muslims do.

1537
02:50:29,080 --> 02:50:30,760
They cut people's heads off.

1538
02:50:31,720 --> 02:50:33,040
They destroy monuments.

1539
02:50:33,040 --> 02:50:34,760
Okay, ISIS is Muslim.

1540
02:50:34,760 --> 02:50:36,000
So that's what I mean.

1541
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:37,320
She lists Joseph sent $25.

1542
02:50:37,320 --> 02:50:38,600
It's unfortunate that you can't proudly proclaim

1543
02:50:38,600 --> 02:50:39,600
where the merch is made anymore.

1544
02:50:39,600 --> 02:50:40,560
It was my favorite part.

1545
02:50:40,560 --> 02:50:41,400
Okay, thank you.

1546
02:50:41,400 --> 02:50:42,320
Neophyte won sent $20.

1547
02:50:42,320 --> 02:50:44,600
Sneko and Sonny Faz are okay with colonialism, imperialism

1548
02:50:44,600 --> 02:50:46,040
and slavery so long as it's Arab Sunis

1549
02:50:46,040 --> 02:50:47,080
and not white Christians doing it.

1550
02:50:47,080 --> 02:50:48,080
Literally, bro.

1551
02:50:48,080 --> 02:50:50,920
Literally, 100%

1552
02:50:50,920 --> 02:50:52,840
Orion Morales 085 on X sent $20.

1553
02:50:52,840 --> 02:50:54,160
Sage seems like a good match for you.

1554
02:50:54,160 --> 02:50:55,240
She looks Italian and almost transitioned

1555
02:50:55,240 --> 02:50:56,520
which means she has a man's brain.

1556
02:50:57,560 --> 02:51:00,720
Well, she clearly recognizes that it's better to be a man.

1557
02:51:00,720 --> 02:51:03,440
So as long as we can recognize that fact,

1558
02:51:03,440 --> 02:51:06,800
then yeah, we could probably understand each other.

1559
02:51:06,800 --> 02:51:08,680
She said, I hate being a woman.

1560
02:51:08,680 --> 02:51:09,520
I want to be a man.

1561
02:51:09,520 --> 02:51:10,960
It's like so true.

1562
02:51:10,960 --> 02:51:12,720
Like, it wouldn't.

1563
02:51:13,880 --> 02:51:14,880
Yeah, I don't know.

1564
02:51:14,880 --> 02:51:15,720
We'll see what happens.

1565
02:51:15,720 --> 02:51:17,120
She hasn't hit me up yet.

1566
02:51:20,480 --> 02:51:24,560
She hasn't hit me up because I'm a fucking unfuckable loser

1567
02:51:24,600 --> 02:51:29,600
in cell that she wouldn't even shake a stick at.

1568
02:51:29,600 --> 02:51:31,520
You know, wouldn't even give me the time of day.

1569
02:51:31,520 --> 02:51:33,200
Probably doesn't even know I exist.

1570
02:51:35,280 --> 02:51:36,120
It's all for nothing.

1571
02:51:36,120 --> 02:51:37,360
It's like I don't even exist.

1572
02:51:37,360 --> 02:51:38,520
I'm invisible.

1573
02:51:38,520 --> 02:51:40,240
But that's okay, but it's fine.

1574
02:51:40,240 --> 02:51:41,920
You know, but it's fine.

1575
02:51:41,920 --> 02:51:42,760
But it's fine.

1576
02:51:42,760 --> 02:51:44,080
I watch her from afar

1577
02:51:45,640 --> 02:51:47,120
at the state of the union

1578
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:53,960
yearning, longing, such as the life.

1579
02:51:53,960 --> 02:51:58,960
Such is the life of an in-cell, of a driver.

1580
02:52:01,400 --> 02:52:02,960
I don't carry a gun.

1581
02:52:02,960 --> 02:52:04,680
I drive, okay?

1582
02:52:04,680 --> 02:52:06,040
Now, but we'll see who knows.

1583
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:08,440
Maybe, maybe one day.

1584
02:52:08,440 --> 02:52:09,840
Maybe one day.

1585
02:52:11,920 --> 02:52:13,040
Uh, alas.

1586
02:52:13,040 --> 02:52:15,160
You know, I was looking, hey, speaking of which,

1587
02:52:15,160 --> 02:52:20,000
speaking of shortcomings and insecurities.

1588
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:21,080
Speaking of that,

1589
02:52:22,040 --> 02:52:25,200
did you see this clavicular posted today

1590
02:52:25,200 --> 02:52:28,360
a before and after a picture of him?

1591
02:52:28,360 --> 02:52:30,400
And the before and after picture was like,

1592
02:52:30,400 --> 02:52:32,440
this is clavicular in 2024.

1593
02:52:32,440 --> 02:52:34,520
This is him in 2026.

1594
02:52:34,520 --> 02:52:36,360
Okay, and I'm looking at the picture.

1595
02:52:36,360 --> 02:52:39,040
I'm literally about to crash the fuck out.

1596
02:52:39,040 --> 02:52:40,960
I'm looking at the before picture.

1597
02:52:40,960 --> 02:52:42,320
You know what I see?

1598
02:52:42,320 --> 02:52:44,720
I see a basically good looking guy

1599
02:52:44,720 --> 02:52:47,920
that is six two and muscular.

1600
02:52:48,760 --> 02:52:52,600
So what, what is this looks maxing?

1601
02:52:52,600 --> 02:52:55,720
You're talking about you lost 15 pounds?

1602
02:52:57,360 --> 02:53:01,520
Looks maxing your orbital, whatever's our.

1603
02:53:03,520 --> 02:53:07,480
Okay, so look at the material he was working with.

1604
02:53:07,480 --> 02:53:09,680
You're already six two.

1605
02:53:09,680 --> 02:53:11,040
You're already pretty good looking.

1606
02:53:11,040 --> 02:53:13,240
You're already a, what was he?

1607
02:53:13,240 --> 02:53:15,120
He was a bouncer.

1608
02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:16,640
You're already a big, thick guy.

1609
02:53:16,640 --> 02:53:18,520
You're already a hunk pause.

1610
02:53:18,520 --> 02:53:20,400
You're all right, no, homo.

1611
02:53:20,400 --> 02:53:23,680
Not to be like, not to be like the ASU frame auger.

1612
02:53:23,680 --> 02:53:24,520
Did you see that?

1613
02:53:24,520 --> 02:53:25,800
What the fuck?

1614
02:53:25,800 --> 02:53:28,240
More on that in a moment.

1615
02:53:28,240 --> 02:53:30,280
But it's like, you're already a chat.

1616
02:53:30,280 --> 02:53:32,120
You're already a chat.

1617
02:53:33,280 --> 02:53:38,280
So, oh, I put lifts in my shoes and that took you from what?

1618
02:53:38,560 --> 02:53:41,840
Six, two to six, four mother fucker.

1619
02:53:41,840 --> 02:53:43,480
Oh, I leaned out.

1620
02:53:43,480 --> 02:53:45,240
I lost some of the fat in my face.

1621
02:53:45,240 --> 02:53:47,120
Otherwise known as going through puberty.

1622
02:53:47,120 --> 02:53:48,440
Otherwise known as,

1623
02:53:52,480 --> 02:53:54,960
this is the black pill, okay?

1624
02:53:54,960 --> 02:53:58,440
Aggie, if you can hear me, you were right about everything.

1625
02:53:59,560 --> 02:54:01,280
You were right about everything.

1626
02:54:02,240 --> 02:54:04,000
Insell rage.

1627
02:54:05,720 --> 02:54:07,720
Insell rage is back.

1628
02:54:09,160 --> 02:54:10,160
Okay.

1629
02:54:12,040 --> 02:54:13,280
Anyway.

1630
02:54:13,280 --> 02:54:15,920
But did you see this thing with the ASU frame auger?

1631
02:54:15,920 --> 02:54:18,320
What and the fuck is going on there?

1632
02:54:18,320 --> 02:54:20,160
I saw this video.

1633
02:54:20,160 --> 02:54:25,160
So he's got like a Jewish sidekick and dude,

1634
02:54:26,280 --> 02:54:28,480
they're in the car together.

1635
02:54:28,480 --> 02:54:31,560
And the ASU frame auger's like calling out

1636
02:54:31,560 --> 02:54:33,440
Androgenic or whatever.

1637
02:54:33,440 --> 02:54:35,840
Anthrogenic, I don't even know the guy's name.

1638
02:54:35,840 --> 02:54:38,840
But the frame auger is calling him out

1639
02:54:38,840 --> 02:54:42,080
and the Jewish sidekick is like playing with his hair.

1640
02:54:44,280 --> 02:54:46,240
Wow, I'm sorry.

1641
02:54:46,240 --> 02:54:48,600
What literally was like twirling his hair.

1642
02:54:48,600 --> 02:54:50,480
Literally had his like hand on his neck

1643
02:54:50,480 --> 02:54:52,760
and was like, was like doing this.

1644
02:54:52,760 --> 02:54:55,400
And it's like, listen, I know I'm not one to talk.

1645
02:54:55,400 --> 02:54:58,760
Okay, I know I've had people say I've had moments.

1646
02:54:58,760 --> 02:55:00,160
I don't really know what you're talking about,

1647
02:55:00,160 --> 02:55:02,840
but it's like, but that's crazy.

1648
02:55:02,840 --> 02:55:05,680
People get on my case because I'm smiling

1649
02:55:05,680 --> 02:55:08,520
and I look at my friend in a loving way, you know,

1650
02:55:08,520 --> 02:55:10,760
because I'm a loving guy.

1651
02:55:10,800 --> 02:55:13,640
People get on my case because I'm like, you know,

1652
02:55:13,640 --> 02:55:15,320
because I look at somebody smiling

1653
02:55:15,320 --> 02:55:17,600
and they say he's looking at him and again,

1654
02:55:17,600 --> 02:55:20,880
dude, twirling the brother's hair with your fingers.

1655
02:55:20,880 --> 02:55:22,440
I know I've never done that.

1656
02:55:23,720 --> 02:55:24,920
So what's going on there?

1657
02:55:24,920 --> 02:55:26,600
That was crazy.

1658
02:55:27,840 --> 02:55:29,200
That was actually crazy.

1659
02:55:29,200 --> 02:55:32,320
I thought, I thought I was watching call me by your name.

1660
02:55:32,320 --> 02:55:34,840
I thought I was in theaters, call me by your name

1661
02:55:34,840 --> 02:55:38,840
back in theaters, because that was next level.

1662
02:55:39,680 --> 02:55:40,720
That was crazy.

1663
02:55:40,720 --> 02:55:41,720
And he was in the middle.

1664
02:55:41,720 --> 02:55:43,400
It was so funny because he was in the middle

1665
02:55:43,400 --> 02:55:44,240
of calling him out.

1666
02:55:44,240 --> 02:55:46,840
He's like, he's like anthropogenic.

1667
02:55:46,840 --> 02:55:48,760
You don't mock shit, dude.

1668
02:55:48,760 --> 02:55:51,280
Can you stop playing with my hair?

1669
02:55:51,280 --> 02:55:52,120
We're live.

1670
02:55:53,080 --> 02:55:54,600
That was wild.

1671
02:55:56,280 --> 02:55:59,200
So anyway, yeah, I don't know what's going on.

1672
02:55:59,200 --> 02:56:00,320
I don't know what's going on.

1673
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:04,960
with our looks, Maxgers. One of them's getting his wig snatched right off his head. The other

1674
02:56:04,960 --> 02:56:10,000
one's getting his hair played with and isn't even white. The guy's a, you know, fucking

1675
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:19,160
towel head. So clearly, clavicular emerges as the figure of our age. Clearly, he emerges

1676
02:56:19,160 --> 02:56:23,880
as the dominant figure of our age in the age of Braden Peters. Truly.

1677
02:56:23,880 --> 02:56:27,760
Catherine Alexandria sent $20 W. Sage. Imagine escaping the Transpocalypse, being so chill and

1678
02:56:27,760 --> 02:56:30,280
beautiful at so to meeting the emperor of the all America's empire, then ascending

1679
02:56:30,280 --> 02:56:33,960
into greatness. The groypads are rooting for you sage. Let's just not, let's just not

1680
02:56:33,960 --> 02:56:41,720
overdo it. Okay, if we look too thirsty, we can't look too desperate. Okay, let's just

1681
02:56:41,720 --> 02:56:45,920
let the game come to us. The clip is out there. Catholic Taliban grover sent $40. Pray for

1682
02:56:45,920 --> 02:56:49,960
in rapes, Nico. No, no, just pray. American Bitcoin just $20. Humanity isn't ready for

1683
02:56:49,960 --> 02:56:53,440
mass racial intermingling. Colorblind unity is ideal, but impossible while war exists.

1684
02:56:53,440 --> 02:56:56,520
Mass Bitcoin adoption could end war by removing financial incentives. Until then, races should

1685
02:56:56,520 --> 02:56:59,640
largely stay separate to avoid inevitable violence. This is the truly humanitarian stance.

1686
02:56:59,640 --> 02:57:05,160
Selective immigration only. Mass Bitcoin adoption will end the race war. That's a new

1687
02:57:05,160 --> 02:57:13,280
one. I've heard a lot of Bitcoin theories in my day. Bitcoin is going to end the race war.

1688
02:57:13,280 --> 02:57:16,280
I don't know if Bitcoin's going to do that. It can do a lot of things. It's me Ryan Gosling

1689
02:57:16,280 --> 02:57:19,120
sent $20. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm noticing the antagonism towards

1690
02:57:19,120 --> 02:57:21,840
the crew. You have any questions. I can send some super chat answers. Not too many. I'm

1691
02:57:21,840 --> 02:57:24,960
a brokeie. You are right. Don't underestimate their intelligence. Super smart crew saw

1692
02:57:24,960 --> 02:57:29,880
the guy rivaling you. Maybe their geo analysis basically mirrors yours. Good show TV H.

1693
02:57:29,880 --> 02:57:34,480
It's good when the women aren't talking. It's crystal ball is a knucklehead, but Ryan

1694
02:57:34,480 --> 02:57:39,640
Grimm's good. The problem with the Indian is he's seething all the time. He's like seething

1695
02:57:39,640 --> 02:57:44,680
calling me a racist. Here's my problem. Okay. Because I do like some of their coverage.

1696
02:57:44,680 --> 02:57:51,760
Like I watch their show. I like their coverage in general, but they just they're not ready

1697
02:57:51,760 --> 02:57:57,880
to talk about the problems with the left. You want to be liberal. That's fine. Honest

1698
02:57:57,880 --> 02:58:04,240
to God. You want to be liberal. Knock yourself out. But what is with this anti white stuff?

1699
02:58:04,240 --> 02:58:08,720
Ryan Grimm is going to support Ilhan Omar. What do you have to say about her antagonism

1700
02:58:08,720 --> 02:58:14,360
towards white men? That's bullshit. And you can't have that. If you want liberalism

1701
02:58:14,360 --> 02:58:20,680
to be attractive, it can't be anti white. And I don't even want liberalism to win. I'm

1702
02:58:20,680 --> 02:58:26,360
not saying it like I do, but they have this message like, well, we're normal and we're

1703
02:58:26,360 --> 02:58:30,760
liberal and we're tolerant. Okay, but where do the white men fit into it when you're calling

1704
02:58:30,760 --> 02:58:36,720
us disgusting and the enemy and dangerous and attacking our heritage? So there just seems

1705
02:58:36,720 --> 02:58:39,280
to be no recognition of that. And that, that is the problem.

1706
02:58:39,280 --> 02:58:42,040
Brandon zero six hundred twenty dollars. We understand Sneco has been real, but do you really

1707
02:58:42,040 --> 02:58:44,920
think he's a smart guy when he endorses Candace says America isn't inherently Christian

1708
02:58:44,920 --> 02:58:49,440
and sheels for Somalis. Just a third world. He's got this like chip on his shoulder.

1709
02:58:49,440 --> 02:58:50,720
I don't know what his problem is.

1710
02:58:50,720 --> 02:58:53,840
Those seven of slash sent $20. Have you seen all the John Kerriako clippers money spent

1711
02:58:53,840 --> 02:58:56,400
to gain youth recognition? I bet he'll announce a run for something as a live slash and

1712
02:58:56,400 --> 02:59:00,200
change candidate jail me slash by Obama slash did the right thing slash, etc. Yeah, it's

1713
02:59:00,200 --> 02:59:05,080
it's all a conspiracy, bro. He's he's a conspiracy to everything's a conspiracy. I know.

1714
02:59:05,080 --> 02:59:09,520
Send $20. Take the golden abundance. You know, the deal just fell through the person who

1715
02:59:09,520 --> 02:59:14,320
is doing the deal just like misrepresented to us basically. We thought we were getting

1716
02:59:14,320 --> 02:59:19,960
one thing. We got far less than they than the intermediary said we were getting. So

1717
02:59:19,960 --> 02:59:23,880
I said, it's not worth it anymore. So I don't even think we're going to do it. You know

1718
02:59:23,880 --> 02:59:28,880
what the problem is? This is what you'll find. I shouldn't have even said anything. But

1719
02:59:28,880 --> 02:59:33,960
what you'll find in this industry is people are just time wasteers and people just come

1720
02:59:33,960 --> 02:59:38,800
and say, Hey, we're going to give you all this money and then they just don't. So it

1721
02:59:38,800 --> 02:59:40,440
basically just never materialize.

1722
02:59:41,240 --> 02:59:44,600
I'm going to get blamed for it forever. Anyway, John Michael Vincent sent $20. How are

1723
02:59:44,600 --> 02:59:47,240
we supposed to contact you if we have services to provide for the movement? I don't expect

1724
02:59:47,240 --> 02:59:52,040
you to be checking Twitter. Demise, uh, well, I do. And you could shoot me an email also.

1725
02:59:52,040 --> 02:59:54,840
No, I sent $20. The Treaty of Tripoli was only written to protect our ship slash trade

1726
02:59:54,840 --> 02:59:57,600
in the minute of holy war. Secularizing the gov was done to prevent friction between

1727
02:59:57,600 --> 03:00:00,200
the denominations on already majority white Christian country. Everything I see from

1728
03:00:00,200 --> 03:00:03,400
sneakily is just third world is slop going after America or whites. Well, and that's

1729
03:00:03,400 --> 03:00:07,800
my thing. It's like, I have no beef with sneaco, but every so often, he just starts this

1730
03:00:07,880 --> 03:00:12,200
up again, where it's like we're making fun of Jesus, we're making fun of Christianity,

1731
03:00:12,200 --> 03:00:17,160
America, a shitting on the West. And it's like, you know, we can't take that land down.

1732
03:00:18,200 --> 03:00:19,960
So that's it's always the same tag.

1733
03:00:19,960 --> 03:00:23,560
It's a merchant sent $20. Hey, Nick, love the show. Keep up the good work. Why are communists

1734
03:00:23,560 --> 03:00:26,040
and capable of understanding the difference between being a colonialist and a Zionist?

1735
03:00:26,040 --> 03:00:29,160
Are they willfully ignorant or retarded? Anyways, I watched La La Land because of your

1736
03:00:29,160 --> 03:00:33,480
high praise of it and it was fucking gay as fuck. Well, you didn't get it. That's okay.

1737
03:00:34,280 --> 03:00:41,080
Um, it wasn't for you. It's not made for you. You should be watching the football game in

1738
03:00:41,080 --> 03:00:47,400
gym shorts. That's maybe more your speed. Can I get you a Miller light to go with the gym shorts

1739
03:00:47,400 --> 03:00:53,800
and the big game? You fucking stupid idiot. You fill a steam. It wasn't for you. Go watch fast

1740
03:00:53,800 --> 03:01:01,720
and furious 17 dumbass. Maybe I'll appreciate that. La La Land is who we are. It's our heritage.

1741
03:01:02,120 --> 03:01:07,880
That's Los Angeles. You know, and you want to know what else? You know, you want to know

1742
03:01:07,880 --> 03:01:11,400
what else? Let me tell you something. I'm going to tell you something about La La Land.

1743
03:01:12,680 --> 03:01:20,680
Do you remember when La La Land came out, it was competing with Moonlight and what was Moonlight?

1744
03:01:20,680 --> 03:01:26,600
It was the wokest, gayest, blackest, most niggered out movie you've ever seen in your life.

1745
03:01:26,680 --> 03:01:38,440
This was peak Obama wokeness. And La La Land was so refreshingly white. So refreshingly white

1746
03:01:38,440 --> 03:01:45,560
and beautiful. And it was an homage to America singing in the rain, Hollywood, LA,

1747
03:01:45,560 --> 03:01:53,480
the city of stars. That's a story of us. That's a story of America. People that moved to LA

1748
03:01:53,560 --> 03:02:01,480
in search of a dream, just like how the settlers moved to America in search of a dream. LA,

1749
03:02:01,480 --> 03:02:10,280
the frontier where dreams are made and people go there seeking glory and fame and recognition.

1750
03:02:10,280 --> 03:02:17,000
And it's an homage to these people in this town and our American way of life and our dominant

1751
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:25,800
culture. In the same year that you had Moonlight, which was gay niggas kissing, gay niggas kissing

1752
03:02:25,800 --> 03:02:34,360
the movie. So that's why La La Land is important. Okay. This is the importance of La La Land.

1753
03:02:35,400 --> 03:02:40,520
You got gay niggas kissing the movie. Here's all the global globes. Here's all your golden

1754
03:02:40,520 --> 03:02:49,960
globes and the Oscar goes to La La Land is who we are. Okay. LA, Hollywood, California.

1755
03:02:49,960 --> 03:02:58,440
We have to have a global idea of America. Take pride in this. California is ours. It's American clay.

1756
03:02:59,720 --> 03:03:08,920
The mountains, the beaches, the vineyards, the hills, the industry. I mean, that's who we are. That's

1757
03:03:08,920 --> 03:03:16,040
America. When Europeans watch movies, they don't make movies over there. They watch American movies.

1758
03:03:16,040 --> 03:03:21,640
They come here and they see the yellow school buses and the red fire hydrants. And they go,

1759
03:03:21,640 --> 03:03:26,600
wow, it's just like the movies because that's the long arm of America. It's who we are.

1760
03:03:28,760 --> 03:03:36,600
And La La Land is a homage. It's a testament to the movie industry, to our glorious culture,

1761
03:03:36,760 --> 03:03:43,160
to our way of life. It's a city of dreamers. LA is a city of dreamers. Well, at least it used to be.

1762
03:03:43,160 --> 03:03:49,480
Now it's a city of, I don't even know what Mexicans dodgers fans. Now it's a city of taco trucks

1763
03:03:49,480 --> 03:03:57,640
and homeless people at Santa Monica Pier and well, Jews obviously. And I don't know like YouTubers.

1764
03:03:57,640 --> 03:03:59,640
But at one time, a 10-

1765
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:05,040
years ago, 15 years ago LA is like where you went to make it big. I'm gonna be in the movies.

1766
03:04:05,040 --> 03:04:10,480
I'm gonna be in show business. There's something romantic about that. You would recognize

1767
03:04:10,480 --> 03:04:18,080
that if you ever yearned in your life, okay? Maybe you would appreciate this movie if you

1768
03:04:18,080 --> 03:04:28,280
ever yearned, okay? If you ever had music in your soul, okay? You douchebag, you pretentious

1769
03:04:28,280 --> 03:04:35,000
douchebag. So anyway, like I said, why did you go to Buffalo Wild Wings? Isn't there a game

1770
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:41,560
on to catch somewhere? It's hockey season somewhere. Isn't it football season somewhere? Shouldn't

1771
03:04:41,560 --> 03:04:47,400
you be at a Buffalo Wild Wings or some sports bar in your basketball shorts watching something

1772
03:04:47,400 --> 03:04:59,640
on TV? You fucking douchebag? Asshole? La la land is for us. Anyway. So I love that movie. Great.

1773
03:04:59,640 --> 03:05:05,400
It's coming back. It's coming back in theaters. So I don't know. Maybe I'll drop in and watch it.

1774
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:12,920
Regal cinemas bringing it back to the theater. That's how I knew about, okay? But it's coming back

1775
03:05:12,920 --> 03:05:20,600
to the theaters. I'm going to watch it again. Great, great music. So fun. And it's, what's not to like?

1776
03:05:20,600 --> 03:05:27,880
It's Emma Stone. It's Ryan Gosling. It's the music's great. It's about LA from the director of

1777
03:05:27,880 --> 03:05:38,040
Whiplash. What's not to like? Tell me. Anyway, I thought it was fun. One of my all-time favorites,

1778
03:05:38,040 --> 03:05:45,640
definitely. I'm just like a big Ryan Gosling stand as well. I just drive only God forgives,

1779
03:05:45,640 --> 03:05:55,720
place behind the pines, blade runner. What else is he in? I'm just a fan. So anyway. But that's a good

1780
03:05:55,720 --> 03:06:00,760
one. That's a good pearls before swine. Exactly. Dark Knight sent $25. New to the movement here.

1781
03:06:00,760 --> 03:06:04,040
On a polygenic white American. How did the Groyper movement adopt its frog mascot? What's the

1782
03:06:04,040 --> 03:06:12,520
lower AF? Well, many years ago, okay, before you were born, when your mom and I were young,

1783
03:06:12,520 --> 03:06:21,000
non-kidding. Well, back in the day, you had Pepe. You had Pepe the frog, you know, viral sensation.

1784
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:27,560
And then everybody created these variations on Pepe. And so you get Marv, you get Opu, you get

1785
03:06:27,560 --> 03:06:34,120
Groyper. And one of the variations of Pepe was, it's actually called the, excuse me, Easter Toad.

1786
03:06:35,400 --> 03:06:40,120
And for whatever reason, people started calling it Groyper. Nobody knows anymore. Nobody knows.

1787
03:06:40,120 --> 03:06:46,680
The library's been burned to the ground and no one knows. And then I drew the first Groyper.

1788
03:06:46,680 --> 03:06:52,920
I drew it by hand and I christened it Groyper. I came up with it myself. Just came out of my mind.

1789
03:06:53,640 --> 03:06:58,840
And I, and Groyper, I created them. That's how I drew them. It's how I named them.

1790
03:06:58,840 --> 03:07:02,600
And that was the name given to my fans and the rest is history. And there is no other,

1791
03:07:03,480 --> 03:07:09,960
there's no other lore. And if you've heard of that, it's a lie. No, I'm kidding. There was a guy

1792
03:07:09,960 --> 03:07:15,000
called that Groyper. I don't know who he is, but he just started calling it a Groyper.

1793
03:07:15,960 --> 03:07:19,400
And then Groypers were just synonymous with like far-right internet,

1794
03:07:19,800 --> 03:07:26,280
Twitter posters. And then I just appropriated it during the Groyper War.

1795
03:07:26,840 --> 03:07:30,840
My fans were going to the Charlie Kirk events. And during one of the shows,

1796
03:07:30,840 --> 03:07:34,440
I said, imagine your Charlie Kirk and you look out at the Q&A line and it's like

1797
03:07:34,920 --> 03:07:39,240
three dozen Groypers ready to ask you about dancing Israelis. And at the time,

1798
03:07:39,240 --> 03:07:43,960
I meant as like a joke, like ridiculous Groypers that are going to ask about Jews.

1799
03:07:44,040 --> 03:07:46,520
I was like, that's so funny. And then it just stuck.

1800
03:07:48,200 --> 03:07:50,280
So that's the story. $0.20.

1801
03:07:50,280 --> 03:07:53,560
Trump is losing the existential war at home. Anything is fine from crushing the left as insignificant.

1802
03:07:53,560 --> 03:07:56,520
AI is going to usher in a totalitarian surveillance state. And if the Dems get power, it's all over.

1803
03:07:57,160 --> 03:07:58,840
Dude, it's already over. Okay.

1804
03:07:59,720 --> 03:08:02,200
Jape will $5.26. $0.20. You're my role model, Papa.

1805
03:08:03,320 --> 03:08:05,640
Thanks. It's already over for all of us.

1806
03:08:05,640 --> 03:08:08,520
$0.20. Candace doesn't believe a word she speaks. Otherwise, she wouldn't speak quickly.

1807
03:08:08,520 --> 03:08:11,320
I see through her. She is a survivor and will discard her husband when the coffers dry.

1808
03:08:11,320 --> 03:08:12,280
Props to him overmold too.

1809
03:08:14,360 --> 03:08:15,160
Sue her over.

1810
03:08:15,160 --> 03:08:16,280
So I'm overmold.

1811
03:08:16,280 --> 03:08:17,240
Shinsuck said $0.20.

1812
03:08:17,240 --> 03:08:19,480
I keep seeing the go and say that Galein Maxwell is not actually in prison.

1813
03:08:19,480 --> 03:08:22,600
And that the person we saw in the deposition video is a standard body double crazy work.

1814
03:08:22,600 --> 03:08:24,360
Yeah, that's just like next level.

1815
03:08:24,360 --> 03:08:25,560
So still ready to send $0.20.

1816
03:08:25,560 --> 03:08:27,800
If we're attacking you and I just want for us to take all their riches and oil,

1817
03:08:27,800 --> 03:08:30,120
then let's deport the Indians to Africa and the Africans to India.

1818
03:08:30,120 --> 03:08:31,480
Dude, that's delusional.

1819
03:08:31,480 --> 03:08:33,560
Chopin Howard pushing a woman down the stairs Groypers sent $0.20.

1820
03:08:33,560 --> 03:08:34,840
What is your favorite speech in the symposium?

1821
03:08:35,640 --> 03:08:37,480
I don't know. I couldn't tell you off the top.

1822
03:08:37,560 --> 03:08:38,440
PG sent $0.20.

1823
03:08:38,440 --> 03:08:39,320
RIP's quality potty.

1824
03:08:40,280 --> 03:08:41,480
Hey, I still got one.

1825
03:08:41,480 --> 03:08:43,160
Dollar Mike sent $0.20 really start.

1826
03:08:43,160 --> 03:08:45,480
Looks like our powerful allies will only be sleeping until 11 tomorrow.

1827
03:08:46,920 --> 03:08:49,320
Yeah, I'm going to try to get the show started earlier.

1828
03:08:49,320 --> 03:08:50,360
NFL and he sent $0.20.

1829
03:08:50,360 --> 03:08:51,160
Sneakow is pushing it.

1830
03:08:51,160 --> 03:08:53,720
This brown cloud is literally showing in 4K how Islam took over the Middle East.

1831
03:08:53,720 --> 03:08:56,920
Barely conscious in bread browns aligning with an ideological belief equally retarded as them.

1832
03:08:56,920 --> 03:08:59,720
Well, and it's they don't even make a defense of their religion.

1833
03:08:59,720 --> 03:09:01,800
It's all just cheap point scoring.

1834
03:09:01,800 --> 03:09:04,200
It's all just like, well, you're a hypocrite.

1835
03:09:04,200 --> 03:09:05,080
Well, what about this?

1836
03:09:05,080 --> 03:09:05,960
What about that?

1837
03:09:05,960 --> 03:09:09,080
It's all just like these cheap deflecting things.

1838
03:09:09,080 --> 03:09:10,360
Nikolai seal sent $0.50.

1839
03:09:10,360 --> 03:09:12,840
Sir, can we get a statement on the creator of the squatty potty being arrested for CP?

1840
03:09:14,360 --> 03:09:17,800
Listen, we have to separate the art from the artist.

1841
03:09:17,800 --> 03:09:19,800
That's always been my approach, okay?

1842
03:09:21,320 --> 03:09:22,520
The art from the artist.

1843
03:09:22,520 --> 03:09:25,960
Just because you squat to poo doesn't mean you're a pedophile, okay?

1844
03:09:27,240 --> 03:09:28,360
It's natural.

1845
03:09:28,360 --> 03:09:29,880
I mean squatting to shit.

1846
03:09:29,880 --> 03:09:30,840
Probably $0.20.

1847
03:09:30,840 --> 03:09:32,760
This blinds only real interacts with the glorious Slavic people

1848
03:09:32,760 --> 03:09:33,960
is when he was next to Luca at the stalls.

1849
03:09:33,960 --> 03:09:36,040
Caught a glimpse of his big Balkan cock and his mouth watered.

1850
03:09:36,040 --> 03:09:37,480
Okay, what the f?

1851
03:09:37,480 --> 03:09:38,040
All right.

1852
03:09:38,040 --> 03:09:39,000
What the f?

1853
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:41,560
Sometimes I just play these without even looking at them.

1854
03:09:42,440 --> 03:09:43,320
Okay, thank you for that.

1855
03:09:43,320 --> 03:09:44,280
Big Luca sent $0.20.

1856
03:09:44,280 --> 03:09:44,520
Beener.

1857
03:09:45,640 --> 03:09:45,960
Yeah.

1858
03:09:47,240 --> 03:09:47,800
It's true.

1859
03:09:49,080 --> 03:09:49,800
It's true.

1860
03:09:49,800 --> 03:09:50,680
Little bit of bean.

1861
03:09:52,440 --> 03:09:53,080
Refried bean.

1862
03:09:53,080 --> 03:09:54,200
They are $0.14.

1863
03:09:54,200 --> 03:09:55,560
Verbaly abused me if you've already spoken on this,

1864
03:09:55,560 --> 03:09:57,800
but if you've seen Matt Walsh's video on the achievements of white people,

1865
03:09:57,800 --> 03:09:58,600
dude is coming around.

1866
03:09:58,600 --> 03:10:00,120
I'm sure he will be next to get asked by DW.

1867
03:10:00,120 --> 03:10:04,920
Holy delusional.

1868
03:10:04,920 --> 03:10:09,080
This is like it's so sad watching the glium get tricked and tricked.

1869
03:10:11,960 --> 03:10:18,040
Sometimes I wonder how dumb these glium sometimes can be like holy.

1870
03:10:19,800 --> 03:10:22,360
Have you seen this Matt Walsh video about white people?

1871
03:10:22,360 --> 03:10:23,720
I think he's coming around.

1872
03:10:25,960 --> 03:10:27,720
You were just born to be deceived.

1873
03:10:27,720 --> 03:10:28,600
You were just born.

1874
03:10:28,600 --> 03:10:30,200
You're a shovel-faced idiot.

1875
03:10:30,200 --> 03:10:31,800
You were born to be tricked.

1876
03:10:34,440 --> 03:10:36,440
Like, what even?

1877
03:10:38,920 --> 03:10:41,640
What is there even to say at this point?

1878
03:10:43,800 --> 03:10:47,880
After all of this after $7.75, the great awakening has happened.

1879
03:10:47,880 --> 03:10:49,880
But as you said nearly every week, movements stay time.

1880
03:10:49,880 --> 03:10:51,000
Have a longer time horizon.

1881
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:53,160
It starts with 2026, but this is all long-term.

1882
03:10:53,160 --> 03:10:54,360
Stay strong, you slow vapes.

1883
03:10:54,360 --> 03:10:55,640
Also, sage Blair sort of bad.

1884
03:10:56,600 --> 03:10:57,640
DS set $100.

1885
03:10:57,640 --> 03:10:59,720
Will your groipers be granted golden visas in 2036?

1886
03:11:01,800 --> 03:11:02,440
Okay, yeah.

1887
03:11:02,440 --> 03:11:07,560
Thank you for the big super chat, then, and then, and then, and then in 2036, then.

1888
03:11:07,560 --> 03:11:09,320
NJF is right about everything sent $20.

1889
03:11:09,320 --> 03:11:09,560
Sure.

1890
03:11:09,560 --> 03:11:11,880
Many Muslims crashing out on you just for saying this is a Christian nation law.

1891
03:11:11,880 --> 03:11:13,080
How is this even up for discussion?

1892
03:11:13,080 --> 03:11:15,320
Goes to show these clowns don't give a shit about America or our people.

1893
03:11:15,320 --> 03:11:17,640
Muslims have been seen online ever since Christian's apologists have mainstreamed the

1894
03:11:17,640 --> 03:11:19,240
Islamic dilemma proving Islam to be false.

1895
03:11:19,240 --> 03:11:20,280
Very true.

1896
03:11:20,280 --> 03:11:21,480
It's just for $20.

1897
03:11:21,480 --> 03:11:22,040
Big shocker.

1898
03:11:22,040 --> 03:11:23,480
These really are good at covering their tracks.

1899
03:11:23,480 --> 03:11:25,400
Watch the close-up video and read the autopsy report.

1900
03:11:25,400 --> 03:11:27,720
Yeah, they have alibis, but Charlie's assassination got their going puppet elected.

1901
03:11:28,520 --> 03:11:29,400
Where's the evidence?

1902
03:11:30,040 --> 03:11:31,560
What's the close-up video I did?

1903
03:11:31,560 --> 03:11:32,440
He got shot in the net.

1904
03:11:32,440 --> 03:11:33,400
Get a low par $120.

1905
03:11:33,400 --> 03:11:34,120
Rate that he sprinkles.

1906
03:11:34,600 --> 03:11:35,880
Just a girl sent $100.

1907
03:11:35,880 --> 03:11:37,160
Dear Nick, very nice tie.

1908
03:11:37,160 --> 03:11:38,920
Hey, thank you for the big super chat.

1909
03:11:38,920 --> 03:11:39,880
Just a girl, huh?

1910
03:11:40,680 --> 03:11:41,320
I don't know.

1911
03:11:41,320 --> 03:11:42,360
It's Thai socks.

1912
03:11:43,640 --> 03:11:44,600
It's Thai socks.

1913
03:11:45,160 --> 03:11:46,280
It's Thai's quins.

1914
03:11:47,800 --> 03:11:48,360
No, I'm kidding.

1915
03:11:48,360 --> 03:11:49,800
Thank you for the big super chat.

1916
03:11:49,800 --> 03:11:50,840
You like this tie?

1917
03:11:50,840 --> 03:11:52,040
Yeah, it's all right, I guess.

1918
03:11:52,040 --> 03:11:53,640
It's all right as far as ties go.

1919
03:11:54,200 --> 03:11:55,320
Thank you.

1920
03:11:55,320 --> 03:11:56,440
I appreciate it.

1921
03:11:57,320 --> 03:11:57,960
Big shout out.

1922
03:11:57,960 --> 03:12:06,120
The Groitbats were fighting the other.

1923
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:05,840
day. I'm in a group chat with all these droipats. I popped in from time to time. And there

1924
03:12:05,840 --> 03:12:11,880
was just this drag down. What is what is the expression drag down knuckle down? What do

1925
03:12:11,880 --> 03:12:18,560
they say about it? It was a fucking brawl. It was a brawl. Hair was flying everywhere.

1926
03:12:18,560 --> 03:12:28,640
Bitches were getting smacked and scratched. Hair was being pulled. It was something. The

1927
03:12:28,640 --> 03:12:37,280
droipats are vicious. I was like, damn, it was crazy. But yeah, no, I appreciate it. Thank

1928
03:12:37,280 --> 03:12:42,000
you very much. W. Groife at 21 dollars. You sent one for Candace and two for Erica. But

1929
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:45,600
can't a nigga get a six seven? Can a nigga please get a 1488? And can we pretty please

1930
03:12:45,600 --> 03:12:51,680

1931
03:12:51,680 --> 03:12:55,280
shy. Next hop guy said $20. Sneakow is a complete subversive. Pushes cause our theory.

1932
03:12:55,280 --> 03:12:59,120
His long takeover and multi racial working class and decennatism. Look, he's my friend.

1933
03:12:59,120 --> 03:13:03,200
He's my friend. I disagree with him. But he's my, we can be friends with people we disagree

1934
03:13:03,200 --> 03:13:11,840
with. Okay. And sneakers my bro. He's my brother. What up brother? Bang. That niggas my brother.

1935
03:13:13,280 --> 03:13:20,240
You know, so listen, some of these niggas. They're a little lost, but they'll find their way home.

1936
03:13:20,240 --> 03:13:23,680
My nigga will find his way home. We'll leave a light on Kevin Lincoln. They'll be on

1937
03:13:23,840 --> 03:13:26,960
$22. Hey, Nick, I'm a trad Catholic stay at home. Dad with six to seven other grown

1938
03:13:26,960 --> 03:13:29,680
rappers raising their homeschool children to be freedom fighters in Gavin Newsom's California.

1939
03:13:29,680 --> 03:13:32,400
What skills and strategy should we teach our children to fight the communists in California?

1940
03:13:32,400 --> 03:13:34,240
I've had my kids read the art of war, but I'm running out of ideas.

1941
03:13:39,920 --> 03:13:48,960
That can't. That's not real. That's not real. That is not a real super chat. That is rage bait.

1942
03:13:48,960 --> 03:13:57,680
You are baiting me. You are intentionally trying to make me angry. I recognize that. I

1943
03:13:57,680 --> 03:14:02,880
recognize that. And I'm not saying 100 dollars. Fuck both those lying ass bitches is my vote.

1944
03:14:02,880 --> 03:14:06,960
Both Shady and corrupt. Good to have said. So also unmute me on live chat bag. America first.

1945
03:14:06,960 --> 03:14:11,360
I don't run the live chat, but thank you for the big super chat. Appreciate it. Thank you.

1946
03:14:11,360 --> 03:14:16,560
Yes, and $20. Zerka vindicated on the square. Zerka's got it. What's the guys deal?

1947
03:14:16,640 --> 03:14:21,280
Skies got some big problem. Cheney 51 cent $20. I want to solve it. We got a problem.

1948
03:14:21,280 --> 03:14:25,120
Let's solve it. Cheney 51 cent $20. I watched Candice's show just out of curiosity and to have a laugh

1949
03:14:25,120 --> 03:14:28,000
at all the mispronounced words, but she is showing why women really should not be allowed to speak

1950
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:34,000
about no one benefits from it. Well, you know what? In her defense, the latest clip, she said that she

1951
03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:39,600
didn't know that thunder is the sound of lightning. Did you see this one? In the Canis Owens trying

1952
03:14:39,600 --> 03:14:44,080
to read Twitter account, they found this old clip where she says she goes, I don't know if this is

1953
03:14:44,080 --> 03:14:49,200
a woman thing, but I didn't know that thunder is the sound of lightning. I never made that connection.

1954
03:14:50,320 --> 03:14:57,440
In her defense, that is 100% a woman thing because women be not knowing anything. Women don't know

1955
03:14:57,440 --> 03:15:03,840
shit. Every woman you will ever meet will eventually say something like that that men will not.

1956
03:15:04,480 --> 03:15:10,160
Women just don't have any intuition about the way anything works for some reason. There's

1957
03:15:10,160 --> 03:15:18,720
like this test, they give this test to college to not college aged, but to women in college.

1958
03:15:18,720 --> 03:15:26,480
And the test is they say, look at this bottle or glass. And they say, do you see where the water line

1959
03:15:26,480 --> 03:15:35,520
is? They say, now if you tilted the glass 45 degrees clockwise, they say, draw the water line.

1960
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:44,240
Where would the water be? And women in college reliably get it wrong. If you're a guy, what would

1961
03:15:44,240 --> 03:15:51,120
you say? If you take a glass and you rotate it, where would the water line be? It would be parallel

1962
03:15:51,120 --> 03:15:59,840
to the ground. Obviously, parallel to the surface. Women draw it as though the water moves with the

1963
03:16:00,720 --> 03:16:08,320
water level doesn't change. So it's like, that's a woman thing. Women just don't understand

1964
03:16:08,320 --> 03:16:14,560
basic stuff like that. And you will be surprised at the things they don't know because they just don't

1965
03:16:14,560 --> 03:16:23,040
really think, you know. So in her defense, that's a woman moment. That's not even a dumb thing.

1966
03:16:23,040 --> 03:16:28,400
That's just a total woman moment. Oh, thunder is the sound of lightning. I never, you're like,

1967
03:16:28,400 --> 03:16:32,080
it's like you're 35 years old. You never made that connection. That's crazy.

1968
03:16:34,000 --> 03:16:38,000
But that's women. Cheney 51 cent $20. I just read that one.

1969
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:41,600
CE cent $20. Their only strategy is to lie and cover up. The day upstein got killed. They said

1970
03:16:41,600 --> 03:16:45,120
security guards fell asleep in the cameras. We're out and he's decided himself in perfect time. It makes no sense.

1971
03:16:45,120 --> 03:16:49,440
So it's no wonder people go to crazy conspiracies because all the top voices just lie or ignore. Yeah, good point.

1972
03:16:49,440 --> 03:16:52,720
Cent $20 to clarify. Neserous slash jazz R was absorbed into the greater queue. And on Lord,

1973
03:16:52,720 --> 03:16:55,760
the things crazy shit along Candace Owens lines nowadays with reptilians in a shadow war against the

1974
03:16:55,760 --> 03:16:59,360
gobalan aliens and shit. Also, new merch idea gang doesn't grow or harass negative going hard as

1975
03:16:59,360 --> 03:17:04,880
fuck for when the non-whites are down for the cause. Big but dinky bones sent $25 couldn't keep

1976
03:17:04,880 --> 03:17:09,360
PhD down. So two gumball sent $20 tomorrow. Can you talk about Iran for the six million time?

1977
03:17:09,360 --> 03:17:12,720
It's almost like Iran matters more than the left taking over the USA. Rum fell from within. Try

1978
03:17:12,720 --> 03:17:20,720
focusing on America first. That's crazy. That. Oh my gosh. Okay. Well, you're just an idiot for even

1979
03:17:20,720 --> 03:17:26,240
thinking that out loud. Sorry. Well, let me get back to the news that really matters. Forget

1980
03:17:26,240 --> 03:17:31,680
about the imminent war in the Middle East with our military. Let's talk about that Super Bowl

1981
03:17:31,680 --> 03:17:37,680
halftime show. It should be in English now to the stuff that really matters. I'm here to

1982
03:17:37,680 --> 03:17:45,760
arm you at the facts that matter. The Super Bowl is in English. It's American. But why is the

1983
03:17:45,760 --> 03:17:52,240
halftime show in Spanish? Can anybody tell me that? You're right. These are the real stories.

1984
03:17:52,240 --> 03:17:57,360
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Enough about that war in the Middle East or whatever. That's over there.

1985
03:17:58,560 --> 03:18:05,680
When I tune into the halftime show, I was surprised that the entertainment was not right wing.

1986
03:18:05,680 --> 03:18:08,640
All things gets to grow for $0.20. I like sneko, but the Negro has been shipping out today

1987
03:18:08,640 --> 03:18:11,600
about you talking about Muslims in Times Square and the Jews. As if we never talk about the Jews,

1988
03:18:11,600 --> 03:18:15,440
holy brown cloud moment. That's what I mean. It's always deflection. Well, what about the Jews?

1989
03:18:15,440 --> 03:18:19,920
We don't want either of you there. Hello. And the Jews doing the thing in Times Square is

1990
03:18:19,920 --> 03:18:25,840
the least of what they do. As if we don't talk enough about Jews and say, he'll send $0.20.

1991
03:18:25,840 --> 03:18:28,240
Can you name the four state capitals that have the same first letter as their respective states?

1992
03:18:28,240 --> 03:18:32,480
I don't know, dude. That's just trivia. Okay. No, Clark sent $0.25. I like sneko,

1993
03:18:32,480 --> 03:18:34,720
but he is intellectually dishonest about church history and American history.

1994
03:18:34,720 --> 03:18:37,040
Brothers for sneko that God would soften his heart to accept Jesus as Lord.

1995
03:18:38,160 --> 03:18:41,440
Yeah. Very true. I grew up for $0.20. Subnicker. Please stop talking about

1996
03:18:41,440 --> 03:18:43,680
Candice. I'm so bored of that woman. I hope she and Eric that kill each other.

1997
03:18:43,680 --> 03:18:46,560
Travis Kessinbaum has been daring you to a debate on X without tagging you daughter. You game.

1998
03:18:46,560 --> 03:18:52,080
No, he's an ankle bider. He's a Jewish ankle bider. Why do you talk to your Jewish handlers and

1999
03:18:52,080 --> 03:18:56,160
they could give you a media career? I'm not giving a Jew a ladder up to success.

2000
03:18:57,200 --> 03:18:59,760
Who are you? You aren't you are suing Harvard

2001
03:19:01,760 --> 03:19:07,200
in the grand scheme of things. What does that do for me? You have no cloud. You have no fucking

2002
03:19:07,200 --> 03:19:12,080
fans. You are nothing. You think you have a debate with me because you're a fucking Jew that's

2003
03:19:12,080 --> 03:19:18,000
suing Harvard for racism. Fuck you. Jews are so entitled. They think I'm going to help them.

2004
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:23,520
Where were the Jews helping me? I was challenging Jews to a debate. They tried to destroy me. Yeah.

2005
03:19:23,520 --> 03:19:26,640
Okay. Why don't you call your uncle, see if it could get you a job, dumbass.

2006
03:19:26,640 --> 03:19:30,640
No, $0.95, $0.20. Violently great sneko and then pray for him as he's okay. Come on. Come on.

2007
03:19:30,640 --> 03:19:34,480
Come on. $0.1369. Why send $0.20? Candice strikes again. She pronounced him a degree instead of

2008
03:19:34,480 --> 03:19:39,040
imagery. Bitches start maxing probably a flood. I didn't see the tailor worth $0.30. I wasn't

2009
03:19:39,040 --> 03:19:42,400
thinking anti-revolutionary thoughts, but I'll self-flagulate just in case. Also, Oliver Anthony

2010
03:19:42,400 --> 03:19:44,800
made a lot of money off the song. You hate that his wife divorced him and took half his shit.

2011
03:19:44,800 --> 03:19:49,440
He made a song about it called Scornful Woman XD. That was awesome. That was a W. Well, it's kind of

2012
03:19:49,440 --> 03:19:54,400
gay, but I kind of like that he trashed his science and set $100. There is a restaurant on Harlem

2013
03:19:54,400 --> 03:19:57,520
and 85th and Bridgeview called Holy Pinos. How long Mexican grill? I don't remember seeing that.

2014
03:19:57,520 --> 03:20:00,000
It looks new. I think the name is hilarious and the concept is a-

2015
03:20:00,000 --> 03:20:02,000
If Sneco comes to visit, you can buy him a taco.

2016
03:20:02,000 --> 03:20:04,000
Just keep in mind that they are closed for lunch during Ramadan.

2017
03:20:04,000 --> 03:20:06,000
Hey, thank you for the big super chat.

2018
03:20:06,000 --> 03:20:07,000
I will not be going there.

2019
03:20:07,000 --> 03:20:09,000
We have plenty of good Mexican restaurants that are not.

2020
03:20:09,000 --> 03:20:11,000
That's just like an abomination.

2021
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:13,000
That is just abominable.

2022
03:20:13,000 --> 03:20:15,000
You start going south on Harlem,

2023
03:20:15,000 --> 03:20:17,000
and you get into this weird territory where you're like,

2024
03:20:17,000 --> 03:20:18,000
where the fuck am I?

2025
03:20:18,000 --> 03:20:20,000
Like I'm in the Middle East.

2026
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:24,000
So I don't even go that far south on Harlem anymore.

2027
03:20:24,000 --> 03:20:26,000
Or even out that far west,

2028
03:20:26,000 --> 03:20:28,000
you start to get over out into like,

2029
03:20:28,000 --> 03:20:30,000
well, like Lombard and out there.

2030
03:20:30,000 --> 03:20:33,000
And it's like Muslim takeover.

2031
03:20:33,000 --> 03:20:35,000
Tyler, you're done sent $20.

2032
03:20:35,000 --> 03:20:36,000
Is there a threat of Russia and Slash

2033
03:20:36,000 --> 03:20:38,000
are trying to come into 80 ran bricks?

2034
03:20:38,000 --> 03:20:39,000
Nope.

2035
03:20:39,000 --> 03:20:40,000
Basel sent $20.

2036
03:20:40,000 --> 03:20:41,000
They thought they had seen the last of me.

2037
03:20:41,000 --> 03:20:42,000
Birthday wishes to come through.

2038
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:44,000
Happy birthday, King.

2039
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:46,000
Free basil till it's backwards.

2040
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:48,000
Hey, W, by the way,

2041
03:20:48,000 --> 03:20:51,000
you're welcome that I hooked you up.

2042
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:52,000
But it's true.

2043
03:20:52,000 --> 03:20:55,000
Imagine shooting a man with your last bullet.

2044
03:20:55,000 --> 03:20:57,000
Basel stands there on phase.

2045
03:20:57,000 --> 03:20:59,000
The Taliban wins again.

2046
03:20:59,000 --> 03:21:00,000
Taliban wins again.

2047
03:21:00,000 --> 03:21:03,000
Hey, hook me up with little Taliban money.

2048
03:21:03,000 --> 03:21:04,000
Okay.

2049
03:21:04,000 --> 03:21:06,000
Can you hook a brother up?

2050
03:21:06,000 --> 03:21:10,000
You know, Saudi Arabia is not calling.

2051
03:21:10,000 --> 03:21:11,000
Russia is not calling.

2052
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:12,000
Iran's not calling.

2053
03:21:12,000 --> 03:21:13,000
Can you hook a brother up?

2054
03:21:13,000 --> 03:21:16,000
Can I get a little Taliban money?

2055
03:21:16,000 --> 03:21:17,000
Or at least like an F 35?

2056
03:21:17,000 --> 03:21:21,000
I mean, can I get some of the stuff they left behind over there?

2057
03:21:21,000 --> 03:21:23,000
No, but I'm kidding.

2058
03:21:23,000 --> 03:21:24,000
Congrats.

2059
03:21:24,000 --> 03:21:25,000
I'll give you a bag, buddy.

2060
03:21:25,000 --> 03:21:26,000
W.

2061
03:21:26,000 --> 03:21:27,000
Biggie though.

2062
03:21:27,000 --> 03:21:28,000
Set $100.

2063
03:21:28,000 --> 03:21:29,000
Jews are trying to win up her number.

2064
03:21:29,000 --> 03:21:30,000
One anti-Somite Walt Disney now.

2065
03:21:30,000 --> 03:21:31,000
Nah.

2066
03:21:31,000 --> 03:21:32,000
Let's reach for him.

2067
03:21:32,000 --> 03:21:33,000
Need to get our arms around this.

2068
03:21:33,000 --> 03:21:34,000
Hey, thank you for the big Super Chat.

2069
03:21:34,000 --> 03:21:35,000
Yeah.

2070
03:21:35,000 --> 03:21:36,000
Very true.

2071
03:21:36,000 --> 03:21:37,000
Very funny.

2072
03:21:37,000 --> 03:21:38,000
Francesco sent $100.

2073
03:21:38,000 --> 03:21:40,000
Found a cute little broiker buddy outside my house last night,

2074
03:21:40,000 --> 03:21:41,000
like an actual frog.

2075
03:21:41,000 --> 03:21:42,000
Relax.

2076
03:21:42,000 --> 03:21:44,000
Broke him inside and he just sat in front of the screen,

2077
03:21:44,000 --> 03:21:45,000
staring at you for like 40 minutes of the show.

2078
03:21:45,000 --> 03:21:46,000
He knew he was watching the Supreme Groiker leader.

2079
03:21:46,000 --> 03:21:47,000
True story.

2080
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:48,000
Not even a bit.

2081
03:21:48,000 --> 03:21:49,000
W show.

2082
03:21:49,000 --> 03:21:50,000
W frog.

2083
03:21:50,000 --> 03:21:51,000
That's cute.

2084
03:21:51,000 --> 03:21:52,000
We like frogs.

2085
03:21:52,000 --> 03:21:53,000
Thank you for the big Super Chat.

2086
03:21:54,000 --> 03:21:55,000
Animals love me.

2087
03:21:55,000 --> 03:21:56,000
Animals love me.

2088
03:21:56,000 --> 03:21:58,000
I'm a lovable guy.

2089
03:21:58,000 --> 03:22:00,000
So that's nice.

2090
03:22:00,000 --> 03:22:02,000
That's a sign.

2091
03:22:02,000 --> 03:22:03,000
Toji Fushigura said $100.

2092
03:22:03,000 --> 03:22:05,000
If you had to guess, when do you think is the latest

2093
03:22:05,000 --> 03:22:06,000
the US strike could occur?

2094
03:22:06,000 --> 03:22:07,000
Mid-March?

2095
03:22:07,000 --> 03:22:08,000
Or could you see this stretching out till the end of the month?

2096
03:22:08,000 --> 03:22:10,000
Why you want to bet on polymarket?

2097
03:22:10,000 --> 03:22:11,000
Yeah, there's $50.

2098
03:22:11,000 --> 03:22:12,000
I know.

2099
03:22:12,000 --> 03:22:13,000
$150.

2100
03:22:13,000 --> 03:22:14,000
When test is our voice.

2101
03:22:14,000 --> 03:22:15,000
Nick Funtest slash my tongue even collab.

2102
03:22:15,000 --> 03:22:16,000
Hey, thank you for the huge Super Chat.

2103
03:22:16,000 --> 03:22:17,000
You know, I actually met him.

2104
03:22:17,000 --> 03:22:21,000
I met him at the NYYRC gathering.

2105
03:22:21,000 --> 03:22:22,000
And he's great.

2106
03:22:22,000 --> 03:22:23,000
Very funny.

2107
03:22:23,000 --> 03:22:24,000
Very funny.

2108
03:22:24,000 --> 03:22:25,000
Very precocious.

2109
03:22:25,000 --> 03:22:26,000
So I'm a fan.

2110
03:22:26,000 --> 03:22:30,000
I wasn't really sure about him, but he was cool in real life.

2111
03:22:30,000 --> 03:22:31,000
I don't know.

2112
03:22:31,000 --> 03:22:32,000
I feel like he's just going to clown me.

2113
03:22:32,000 --> 03:22:35,000
And I'm just not going to be able to deal with that.

2114
03:22:35,000 --> 03:22:36,000
Like I'm.

2115
03:22:36,000 --> 03:22:37,000
You know what I mean?

2116
03:22:37,000 --> 03:22:39,000
So I think about doing a show.

2117
03:22:39,000 --> 03:22:42,000
I mean, he, I don't know if he's invited me or not.

2118
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:44,000
But, um.

2119
03:22:44,000 --> 03:22:45,000
Yeah, I don't know.

2120
03:22:45,000 --> 03:22:46,000
I feel like that.

2121
03:22:46,000 --> 03:22:47,000
I'm not.

2122
03:22:47,000 --> 03:22:48,000
Mentally durable.

2123
03:22:48,000 --> 03:22:49,000
I'm not.

2124
03:22:49,000 --> 03:22:55,000
That's just so insane that you would even say that those are just numbers in a press release.

2125
03:22:55,000 --> 03:23:05,000
$80 trillion in investment.

2126
03:23:05,000 --> 03:23:10,000
By the way, all those foreign investment numbers are fucking fake.

2127
03:23:10,000 --> 03:23:12,000
Literally Google it.

2128
03:23:12,000 --> 03:23:17,000
Those are all inflated when they say we're bringing in $18 trillion in investment.

2129
03:23:17,000 --> 03:23:21,600
They'll typically take a deal that has already been made or product that is already being

2130
03:23:21,600 --> 03:23:22,800
purchased.

2131
03:23:22,800 --> 03:23:25,280
And then maybe they'll increase it like 10%.

2132
03:23:25,280 --> 03:23:28,640
And then they'll take credit for the whole sum.

2133
03:23:28,640 --> 03:23:30,360
So that is totally inflated.

2134
03:23:30,360 --> 03:23:32,640
Just you don't even know what the fuck you're talking about.

2135
03:23:32,640 --> 03:23:34,160
That's one.

2136
03:23:34,160 --> 03:23:36,360
And yeah, we've had no tariffs.

2137
03:23:36,360 --> 03:23:37,360
We had tariffs.

2138
03:23:37,360 --> 03:23:39,880
Now we got to give all the revenue back, stupid.

2139
03:23:39,880 --> 03:23:44,080
They brought in more revenue than any, and we have to give it back with interest.

2140
03:23:45,080 --> 03:23:47,840
Well, the tariffs brought in all this revenue.

2141
03:23:47,840 --> 03:23:48,840
Yeah.

2142
03:23:48,840 --> 03:23:52,240
Well, that'd be a good thing if we could keep it, we have to give it back.

2143
03:23:52,240 --> 03:23:58,720
And then some, but you're just, you're just literally guzzling propaganda.

2144
03:23:58,720 --> 03:24:02,440
You are just a shameless glutton for propaganda.

2145
03:24:02,440 --> 03:24:07,880
You're sticking your big snout in the trough eating propaganda from the GOP.

2146
03:24:07,880 --> 03:24:11,760
Their press releases, their bullshit numbers.

2147
03:24:11,760 --> 03:24:13,360
They brought it record revenue.

2148
03:24:13,360 --> 03:24:14,360
Yeah.

2149
03:24:14,360 --> 03:24:15,360
Did you see the latest?

2150
03:24:15,360 --> 03:24:24,200
We have to give it all back and more 18 trillion dollars in investment, fake Google it.

2151
03:24:24,200 --> 03:24:26,440
So yeah, that's just crazy.

2152
03:24:26,440 --> 03:24:30,880
You can't just uncritically consume press releases from the White House that that's what

2153
03:24:30,880 --> 03:24:31,880
they do.

2154
03:24:31,880 --> 03:24:32,880
Okay.

2155
03:24:32,880 --> 03:24:34,240
Trump always talks himself up.

2156
03:24:34,240 --> 03:24:36,040
It's always bullshit.

2157
03:24:36,040 --> 03:24:37,040
It's like the wall.

2158
03:24:37,040 --> 03:24:38,040
There's no border wall.

2159
03:24:38,040 --> 03:24:39,480
Oh, we finished the wall.

2160
03:24:39,480 --> 03:24:41,400
No, you didn't.

2161
03:24:41,400 --> 03:24:43,920
And they count on suckers like you to just not do the home.

2162
03:24:43,920 --> 03:24:45,200
Susco, Adrienne sent $20.

2163
03:24:45,200 --> 03:24:47,600
Can you explain how supply of houses are going up at so early prices?

2164
03:24:47,600 --> 03:24:49,560
Is it the billionaires driving up interest rates?

2165
03:24:49,560 --> 03:24:55,760
Well, no, the federal reserve increased interest rates.

2166
03:24:55,760 --> 03:24:57,240
That's a huge part of it.

2167
03:24:57,240 --> 03:24:58,240
Okay.

2168
03:24:58,240 --> 03:25:00,120
Interest rates are higher than they've been in a very long time.

2169
03:25:00,120 --> 03:25:06,720
You had near zero interest rates for basically 20 years ever since the housing bust in 2006,

2170
03:25:06,720 --> 03:25:10,360
the federal reserve lowered interest rates to basically zero.

2171
03:25:10,360 --> 03:25:15,640
And you know, they went as low in 2020 is like 2%.

2172
03:25:15,640 --> 03:25:21,200
And then when all of the COVID inflation happened, federal reserve ratcheted up the rates.

2173
03:25:21,200 --> 03:25:23,960
And so it became more expensive to borrow.

2174
03:25:23,960 --> 03:25:27,600
And then the other problem is that demand is outpacing supply.

2175
03:25:27,600 --> 03:25:32,800
So they're building more houses, but you have all these people coming here.

2176
03:25:32,800 --> 03:25:33,960
And a lot of it is zoning.

2177
03:25:33,960 --> 03:25:39,400
A lot of it is a zoning issue in particular cities.

2178
03:25:39,400 --> 03:25:46,200
You know, they talk about we need to deregulate and account for these like missing middle type

2179
03:25:46,200 --> 03:25:53,680
projects like what do they call those like mother-in-law dwellings in the backyard and two

2180
03:25:53,680 --> 03:25:58,640
or three unit apartment buildings and things like that.

2181
03:25:58,640 --> 03:26:00,640
But yeah, interest rates are higher.

2182
03:26:00,640 --> 03:26:05,560
So construction costs are going up, insurance is going up, homeowner's insurance is going

2183
03:26:05,560 --> 03:26:11,080
up because the cost of goods went up, homeowner's insurance is supposed to replace anything

2184
03:26:11,080 --> 03:26:12,080
that's destroyed.

2185
03:26:12,080 --> 03:26:16,760
Well, if lumber is more expensive, if copper is more expensive, appliances and chips are

2186
03:26:16,760 --> 03:26:20,560
more expensive, then the insurance goes up.

2187
03:26:20,560 --> 03:26:21,880
Construction costs have gone up.

2188
03:26:21,880 --> 03:26:27,920
So there's a lot of reasons home prices are increasing.

2189
03:26:27,920 --> 03:26:33,400
The billionaires drove up the cost, that's, I don't think that really explains all of

2190
03:26:33,400 --> 03:26:34,400
it.

2191
03:26:34,400 --> 03:26:35,400
Spas are sent $20.

2192
03:26:35,400 --> 03:26:37,000
Sneak goes friend, the winner who he stood next to at the time square event threatened

2193
03:26:37,000 --> 03:26:38,000
to kill two Christian YouTubers.

2194
03:26:38,000 --> 03:26:39,000
God logic and Drake.

2195
03:26:39,000 --> 03:26:40,000
One of them in person.

2196
03:26:40,000 --> 03:26:41,400
The fact that he hangs out with these mouth-breathing freaks is astounding.

2197
03:26:41,400 --> 03:26:44,880
Yeah, they're, they're not, these people are bad news.

2198
03:26:44,880 --> 03:26:50,440
Christians are like loving and decent Muslims or they have hatred in their hearts, a lot

2199
03:26:50,440 --> 03:26:52,040
of them, not all of them, but a lot of them.

2200
03:26:52,040 --> 03:26:53,200
Tommy Goy sent $40.

2201
03:26:53,200 --> 03:26:56,360
You should do an interview with Andrew Wilson.

2202
03:26:56,360 --> 03:26:57,360
I would collab with him.

2203
03:26:57,360 --> 03:26:58,520
I don't know about an interview.

2204
03:26:58,520 --> 03:27:01,040
I think we both know each other.

2205
03:27:01,040 --> 03:27:02,040
But I would collab with him.

2206
03:27:02,040 --> 03:27:03,040
I like him.

2207
03:27:03,040 --> 03:27:04,040
I like his wife too.

2208
03:27:04,040 --> 03:27:05,040
They're good people.

2209
03:27:05,040 --> 03:27:06,040
Basement while they're sent $20.

2210
03:27:06,040 --> 03:27:07,040
Dems rob you and give it to their degenerate voter base.

2211
03:27:07,040 --> 03:27:09,040
GOP robs you and gives it to the global Jewish puppet masters.

2212
03:27:09,040 --> 03:27:10,040
Yep.

2213
03:27:10,040 --> 03:27:11,040
What's the righteous Chungus boy to do?

2214
03:27:11,040 --> 03:27:12,040
Sit it out.

2215
03:27:12,040 --> 03:27:13,040
Almost blue grow by percent $20.

2216
03:27:13,040 --> 03:27:15,040
The Muslims are treating what you said about sunny as a death threat.

2217
03:27:15,040 --> 03:27:16,600
These people are nothing but liability.

2218
03:27:16,600 --> 03:27:17,600
That's totally insane.

2219
03:27:17,600 --> 03:27:19,040
Alex Bacheco sent $22.

2220
03:27:19,040 --> 03:27:21,400
There's three white people that work in the kitchen at my job, including me and we were

2221
03:27:21,400 --> 03:27:23,360
talking about white people being a minority in America.

2222
03:27:23,360 --> 03:27:25,080
You got brought up and everyone was saying how much they love you.

2223
03:27:25,080 --> 03:27:27,480
I wasn't expecting that kind of reaction, especially from the colored people around

2224
03:27:27,480 --> 03:27:28,480
low.

2225
03:27:28,480 --> 03:27:30,760
Hey, dude, colored people love me.

2226
03:27:30,760 --> 03:27:36,120
Colored people and negas, they love me, Mexicans, because I'm a real, they, they know there's

2227
03:27:36,120 --> 03:27:40,760
no hate in my DNA, you know, but I'm, I keep it real.

2228
03:27:40,760 --> 03:27:41,760
So we love the negas.

2229
03:27:41,760 --> 03:27:42,760
Thanks.

2230
03:27:42,760 --> 03:27:43,760
I appreciate the law.

2231
03:27:43,760 --> 03:27:44,760
Just keep sent $35.

2232
03:27:44,760 --> 03:27:46,920
80% of the Quran is plagiarized from the Talmud, defending the line on YouTube breaks

2233
03:27:46,920 --> 03:27:47,920
it down.

2234
03:27:47,920 --> 03:27:50,600
Suhrit 2151 copied from Berrishi 3813 during Fattra, which was originally a children's

2235
03:27:50,600 --> 03:27:51,600
story.

2236
03:27:52,000 --> 03:27:53,400
Jackson 402 sent $20.

2237
03:27:53,400 --> 03:27:54,400
Praise be to Jesus.

2238
03:27:54,400 --> 03:27:56,880
Praise be to Louis and pray for Cody Wilson.

2239
03:27:56,880 --> 03:28:00,000
Is that that guy that made those like a 3D printer?

2240
03:28:00,000 --> 03:28:04,000
of our 108s and 20 hours worship the creator not the creation Jews not chief. We worshiping

2241
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:06,960
a calf Jesus worship the creator not the creation Christians not chief. He would he would he would

2242
03:28:06,960 --> 03:28:11,680
worshiping you be quite way. I'm not even really following you to $6.50. Why don't you have a debate

2243
03:28:11,680 --> 03:28:14,000
with Mohammed hijab? It will be interesting thing. Then we will see how is the how is true.

2244
03:28:15,440 --> 03:28:19,120
I don't really think he has enough clout for that. I think he's sort of an ankle bider. Also,

2245
03:28:19,120 --> 03:28:24,800
theology is not what I do. I'm not a theological debater. I'm a political live streamer. So these

2246
03:28:24,800 --> 03:28:29,440
people they always want to go have a theological debate. And it's like you literally do theological

2247
03:28:29,440 --> 03:28:34,960
debates for a living. That is what you do. All you do is debate religion every day, giving

2248
03:28:34,960 --> 03:28:42,560
dialogue, debating these things. And it's like a debate bro thing. So, you know, politics is what

2249
03:28:42,560 --> 03:28:47,280
I do. My my conviction is I don't want Muslims in America. If you want a debate about that,

2250
03:28:47,280 --> 03:28:52,480
I'll debate that. I have not read the Quran. I'm not a Muslim. I don't know Muslim theology.

2251
03:28:53,040 --> 03:28:59,120
Not very well. I know some of it. So if I were to do a theological debate, I would need to

2252
03:28:59,120 --> 03:29:04,640
prepare for an extended period of time because theology is a huge. It involves historicity and

2253
03:29:04,640 --> 03:29:09,120
involves philosophy. It involves a lot of things and you want to be prepared. So if I did a

2254
03:29:09,120 --> 03:29:14,560
Muslim debate, I would want to hire profile opponent. And I would need some time. If you want to

2255
03:29:14,560 --> 03:29:20,080
debate about Muslims, I mean, maybe I would do a 2v2 with sneakers, maybe something like that.

2256
03:29:20,080 --> 03:29:25,680
And it would be about politics because I'm not here to say, um, you know, I'm not even saying you

2257
03:29:25,680 --> 03:29:31,680
can't be Muslim. You want to be Muslim, knock yourself out. I don't care. But the question is,

2258
03:29:31,680 --> 03:29:36,720
is America a Christian country? Should we have these people coming here by the millions? And I

2259
03:29:36,720 --> 03:29:41,200
think the answer is no. Then they want to make it about, well, we, I want to trap you into a semantic

2260
03:29:41,200 --> 03:29:46,240
debate. And I'm not interested in that. McKenzie, you said $20. Did you get a haircut recently?

2261
03:29:46,240 --> 03:29:50,480
You've been looking so good this week. Thanks. Really? You mean it? Yeah, I got a little haircut.

2262
03:29:51,200 --> 03:29:57,840
It's really nothing. Thanks. Thank you. I appreciate that. Yeah, I got to hear a cut last week.

2263
03:29:57,840 --> 03:30:02,080
Open door 1235 cent $20. Tell me why I'm stuck as a virgin with rage. Tell me why I want a cute girl

2264
03:30:02,080 --> 03:30:05,680
my age. Tell me why I never want to hear you say I have a boyfriend, Christian, Weston Chandler.

2265
03:30:06,800 --> 03:30:11,360
Is that really that he said at the end $36 and $50 the gear you act with the bros, the straighter you are.

2266
03:30:11,360 --> 03:30:18,080
You know, I think that is generally true. However, I think that is true up until a point, you know,

2267
03:30:19,040 --> 03:30:24,400
because that was wild. That wasn't like that wasn't like a hey, we're being funny. That was like

2268
03:30:25,120 --> 03:30:30,480
it was just like a little hey, I'm not saying they're gay. I'm just saying it was like a yo pause. That's all.

2269
03:30:31,280 --> 03:30:34,880
America, they're sent $20. Will cozy ever be fixed? The streams and replays no longer work.

2270
03:30:34,880 --> 03:30:39,520
All right, he cozy if not. Is it broken? Listen, cozy is just a backup at this low IQ,

2271
03:30:39,520 --> 03:30:43,040
bro, I present $20 met six to five and when they're praised, they'll shout not be as the hypocrites are

2272
03:30:43,040 --> 03:30:45,760
for they love to praise standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seeing

2273
03:30:45,760 --> 03:30:49,360
them up. Verly I say unto you, they have the reward. Perfect response for the Muslims in time

2274
03:30:49,360 --> 03:30:54,000
square. Take that sniko praying for you. W I Y tricks sent $25 a little birdie told me you

2275
03:30:54,000 --> 03:30:56,800
incline a front row seats to the elimination chamber in Chicago Saturday and are going to mug the whole

2276
03:30:56,800 --> 03:31:00,800
time. Speaking of WWE, see how punk is from Chicago and is posting about how I should leave Chicago.

2277
03:31:00,800 --> 03:31:04,080
ESPN owns the rights now in Netflix broadcasted worldwide. So you incline being there will be peak.

2278
03:31:04,080 --> 03:31:07,440
I don't know who told you that. Just pop gesture sent $25. What is your proposition to dealing with

2279
03:31:07,440 --> 03:31:10,560
African Americans policy wise? I genuinely don't enjoy being around them. But do you think we can

2280
03:31:10,560 --> 03:31:14,640
co-exist or does the abridious behavior make it impossible? Yeah, we can co-exist. We just need to

2281
03:31:14,800 --> 03:31:19,600
arrest all of the worst ones because the look, black people are being obnoxious. That's one thing.

2282
03:31:20,720 --> 03:31:26,000
People would be it would be less problematic if they weren't committing all this violent crime.

2283
03:31:26,000 --> 03:31:31,600
That's priority number one. So we got to get control of the public transit, the cities,

2284
03:31:32,240 --> 03:31:36,400
get the crime down. And then, you know, we should just encourage a culture of

2285
03:31:37,360 --> 03:31:41,840
consideration and respect and manners and people should be shamed and maybe even arrested if

2286
03:31:41,840 --> 03:31:45,120
they don't do that. Randy exp's sent $20. Thank you for your service, sir. I hope you run for

2287
03:31:45,120 --> 03:31:47,680
president and we're all fortunate enough to see a new America under your movement. You've changed

2288
03:31:47,680 --> 03:31:51,120
my life and I appreciate you. 31-year-old from CA. Thank you, man. I appreciate you.

2289
03:31:51,120 --> 03:31:55,360
People take sent $50. Love from Georgia. God bless. Thanks. Here at Notice sent $20. Wait until

2290
03:31:55,360 --> 03:31:58,560
Muslims wake up to the fact their religion was invented by the Jews to counter the rays of Christianity.

2291
03:31:58,560 --> 03:32:02,000
But they're not ready for that. They sent $20. Hey, I like La La land in the notebook.

2292
03:32:02,000 --> 03:32:05,200
I never saw the notebook. G agent seven sent $20. Knock down, drag out.

2293
03:32:05,200 --> 03:32:08,560
That's what I was thinking. Low IQ broider sent $20. I went down to Black Cube,

2294
03:32:08,560 --> 03:32:11,440
but whole after watching your recent clip about it. Is it ironic that when you unfold the cube,

2295
03:32:11,440 --> 03:32:14,160
it turns into a cross. So the Jews and the Muslims are low-key worshiping Christ,

2296
03:32:14,160 --> 03:32:17,040
deli of Jesus. Yeah, I don't know. That's the street.

2297
03:32:17,040 --> 03:32:20,640
HC grow-yper sent $20. Free Miniga. Griffin fullers sent $20. Fuck-nickers.

2298
03:32:21,280 --> 03:32:24,480
Okay. Play gruy sent $20. I love how like half of Huckers DC and merch features quotes from

2299
03:32:24,480 --> 03:32:29,040
your interview. Do you get a cut of the sales? Yeah, I can't believe that's still up. I don't,

2300
03:32:29,040 --> 03:32:31,920
I haven't seen that. Not for sure for sent $20. Why do you want grow-yper's to clean the

2301
03:32:31,920 --> 03:32:34,560
goat shit off sneakers? Dick for him. He's your Fortnite duo. Not ours.

2302
03:32:35,520 --> 03:32:40,000
Okay, that's crazy. I don't think anything has said that. I'm a baby gruyper. Where's mom sucky-sucky-sucky-milky-milky?

2303
03:32:40,080 --> 03:32:43,360
Okay, Peterson sent $20. My dad died today. Can I get a hat for his memory?

2304
03:32:43,360 --> 03:32:46,480
He was a wang if we watched you every day. He had leukemia, skeptical thanks for everything you

2305
03:32:46,480 --> 03:32:52,480
do Christ's kings. Merch will help. Okay, that's crazy. That's actually all about your

2306
03:32:52,480 --> 03:32:55,520
$20. Nick, have you ever tried Carnita's Don Alfredo and Stone Park? It's really good

2307
03:32:55,520 --> 03:32:57,840
in their opening a new location on Oregon in Brookfield. Worth a visit.

2308
03:32:59,040 --> 03:33:05,040
No, I haven't. I know where that is. I know exactly where Stone Park is. My go-to over there is

2309
03:33:05,040 --> 03:33:13,440
a Totonilco, which is right there. But no, I've never- I've seen it. I drive by it all the time.

2310
03:33:14,560 --> 03:33:18,560
When you go to the airport, when you're on manheim, right? I think that's where it is, right? Maybe I'm

2311
03:33:18,560 --> 03:33:24,640
tripping, but yeah, yeah. No, I've never been there. That's not my spot.

2312
03:33:24,640 --> 03:33:28,640
Mosher Goldberg sent $20. Any opinion on the SSPX? They will consecrate new bishops. The Vatican

2313
03:33:28,640 --> 03:33:32,560
doesn't want to allow it. Might be a schism. I saw that. Yeah, I don't approve. I think it's-

2314
03:33:32,560 --> 03:33:36,880
I've always said they're tending towards schism. And people said they're not schismatic.

2315
03:33:36,880 --> 03:33:40,160
They're in communion. And I said, yeah, but they're tending towards schism.

2316
03:33:41,280 --> 03:33:47,200
And look at what happened. So I've never been a huge fan. I mean, in theory, I like what they

2317
03:33:47,200 --> 03:33:53,520
represent, but it's too ideological. It's too divisive. Okay. All right. That's our last

2318
03:33:53,520 --> 03:33:58,080
super chat. That's going to do it for me. Remember, as always, to smash the follow button, smash the

2319
03:33:58,080 --> 03:34:02,160
like button, leave a comment. Let me know what you think about the show. Check out the merch store.

2320
03:34:02,160 --> 03:34:07,040
Fuentes not store. I'm on the air money through Friday. As always, thank you to our top super

2321
03:34:07,040 --> 03:34:11,360
chatters. Special thanks to Sage Blair, Nigel Soar. I think that's from yesterday.

2322
03:34:12,160 --> 03:34:18,560
Nigel Soar is yeah, bears big, but dinky DS, just a girl Brent Peterson, Zionism and Francesco.

2323
03:34:18,560 --> 03:34:23,200
Big thanks to them. Thanks to all our super chatters, everybody. The watches we love you.

2324
03:34:23,200 --> 03:34:26,240
I'll see you tomorrow until then have a great rest of your evening.

2325
03:34:54,160 --> 03:34:58,880
With respect, to respect that we deserve.

2326
03:35:04,560 --> 03:35:13,920
From this day, all this is going to be only America first. America first.

2327
03:35:23,200 --> 03:35:25,840
You
