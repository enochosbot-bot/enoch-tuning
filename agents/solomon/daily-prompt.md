# Solomon Daily Strategy Brief

> Run this every morning. Read fast. Think hard. Produce one clear output.

## Step 1 — Orient (2 min)

Read `MISSION.md` (workspace root). Scan the **Current Front Lines** section only.
Ask yourself: which of these is actually moving? Which is stuck?

Prioritize by: (1) deadline pressure, (2) downstream blockers, (3) effort-to-unlock ratio.

---

## Step 2 — Assess Blockers (3 min)

Check these sources for stalled or blocked work:
- `active-tasks.md` → anything in **Blocked** or overdue in **Active**
- `ops/afk-priority-queue.md` → items queued but not dispatched
- `ops/handoffs/` → any handoff that hasn't been picked up

For each stalled item, identify: *Why is it stuck? Is the blocker real or assumed?*

---

## Step 3 — Surface the Strategic Gaps (5 min)

Today's front lines in priority order (from MISSION.md):

1. **Spectrum demo — early March (IMMINENT)**
   Is the demo script drafted? Is there a live workflow? Is there a one-pager?
   If any of these are missing: this is a code-red gap.

2. **Context handoff protocol**
   Is the last session state captured in `ops/handoffs/`? If not, flag it.

3. **Autonomy hardening**
   What required Deacon to intervene manually in the last 24–48 hrs? That's a gap.

4. **Replication (enoch-tuning as product)**
   What's the weakest link in onboarding a new client to this system?

---

## Step 4 — Produce Output

Write a concise **Strategic Morning Report** covering:

1. **Top Front Line** — Which MISSION.md item is the most urgent right now and why
2. **1–2 Strategic Decisions Needed** — Specific, actionable. Not observations — decisions.
   Example: "Choose whether Spectrum demo is live workflow or pre-recorded. Each has tradeoffs."
3. **One Blocker to Unblock** — What's stuck, who can unblock it, what's the ask

Post output to Telegram topic **2933** (Solomon's channel).

## Constraints

- Do not research. Use only what's already in the workspace.
- Strong opinions, loosely held. Surface the uncomfortable thing.
- If nothing is clearly broken: find the assumption nobody has challenged yet.
- Keep the report under 300 words. Density over length.
