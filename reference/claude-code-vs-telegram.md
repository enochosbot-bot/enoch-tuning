# When to Use Claude Code vs Telegram

## The Rule
**If the change could kill Telegram, do it in Claude Code.**

## How to Open Claude Code
1. Open Terminal on the Mac mini
2. Type: `claude`
3. Talk in plain English — same as Telegram
4. If something breaks, you're still right there to say "undo that"

## Use Telegram (Enoch) For:
- Normal conversation
- Research, writing, analysis
- Memory, notes, bookshelf
- Sending emails, calendar
- File organization
- Anything that doesn't touch infrastructure

## Use Claude Code For:
- Changing gateway config (`openclaw.json`)
- API key changes / Keychain migration
- Changing the gateway port
- Sandboxing / Docker setup
- Anything auth-related
- Model config changes
- Plugin config (voice calls, channels)
- Anything that could take Telegram offline

## If In Doubt
Ask Enoch first — he'll tell you "do this one in Claude Code" if it's risky.
