## Key Decisions
1. Launch beta by end of March
2. Focus on mobile experience first
3. Onboarding flow needs redesign

## Action Items
- [ ] Draft new onboarding wireframes
- [ ] Set up analytics for beta tracking
- [ ] Schedule design review for next week

## Notes
The team agreed that **simplicity** is the priority. No feature bloat. Ship the core loop and iterate.
