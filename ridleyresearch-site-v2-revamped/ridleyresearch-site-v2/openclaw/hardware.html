      <h1>Hardware for AI Agents</h1>
      <p class="muted">OpenClaw section · 6 min read</p>

      <!-- INTRO -->
      <div class="hw-intro">
        <p>Most conversations about AI skip the hardware question entirely. They shouldn't. When you're running an AI agent stack — not an app you open and close, but infrastructure that operates continuously on your behalf — the machine underneath it matters more than most people expect.</p>
        <p>It affects how hot your room gets. How much your electricity bill moves. Whether you hear a fan at 2 AM. And whether the system you're building today can handle the models that exist two years from now.</p>
        <p><strong>We have a clear opinion on this.</strong> Here's how we got there, and what we'd recommend to anyone setting up a serious deployment.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION: Why hardware matters -->
      <div class="hw-section">
        <h2>This Isn't a Laptop You Close at Night</h2>
        <p>Standard advice for buying a computer optimizes for portability, screen quality, or raw benchmark performance. None of those things matter much here.</p>
        <p>An agent stack runs continuously. It handles scheduled jobs at 3 AM. It processes incoming messages while you're in a meeting. It runs research tasks in the background while you do other work. The machine needs to handle sustained, mixed workloads — not just occasional bursts — without becoming a heat source, a noise problem, or a power drain you notice on your bill.</p>
        <p>That's a different set of requirements. And it points to a different kind of hardware.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION: Why Apple Silicon -->
      <div class="hw-section">
        <h2>Why We Run on Apple Silicon</h2>
        <p>Our deployment runs on a Mac mini. It sits in a bedroom. It has been running for months without interruption.</p>
        <p><strong>It has never once been audible.</strong></p>
        <p>That's the detail that matters most and gets mentioned least in hardware comparisons. When your infrastructure runs 24 hours a day, silence isn't a luxury — it's a requirement. A machine that spins up fans under load is a machine that degrades your environment every time it works hard. Apple Silicon was engineered to avoid exactly that.</p>
        <p>The technical reason is the architecture. M-series chips use a unified memory design — the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine share the same high-bandwidth memory pool instead of passing data between separate chips. For AI workloads, which constantly move large amounts of data between compute units, this is significantly more efficient than conventional designs. The result is real performance delivered with less heat and less power draw.</p>
        <p>In practice: it runs serious AI workloads continuously, stays cool, stays quiet, and draws around 10–20 watts under typical load. A comparable x86 machine doing similar work would draw 3–5× more power and would need active cooling to manage the heat.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION: Comparison -->
      <div class="hw-section">
        <h2>The Honest Comparison</h2>
        <p>OpenClaw runs on Mac, Linux, and Windows. All three work. But they're not equivalent for this use case.</p>

        <table class="comparison-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Platform</th>
              <th>Verdict</th>
              <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Apple Silicon Mac <span class="verdict-tag recommended">Recommended</span></td>
              <td>Best overall</td>
              <td>Silent, efficient, reliable. Best local inference performance per watt. Lowest friction for setup and maintenance. What we deploy on.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Linux <span class="verdict-tag">Viable</span></td>
              <td>Good for experienced users</td>
              <td>Legitimate option, especially on a dedicated server or VPS. More configuration overhead. Things that just work on macOS sometimes require troubleshooting. Better budget option if you're comfortable in the terminal.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Windows <span class="verdict-tag">Works</span></td>
              <td>Adds friction</td>
              <td>OpenClaw installs and runs. But comparable hardware runs hotter and louder, and Windows is a less natural environment for the command-line tooling this stack depends on. More background maintenance. Not what we'd choose.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>GPU Rig <span class="verdict-tag">Specialty</span></td>
              <td>Overkill for most</td>
              <td>If you're running very large local models at scale, there's a case for dedicated GPU hardware. For the workflows most small teams care about, a Mac mini outperforms anything in its price range — without the noise, heat, and power cost.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION: Future proofing -->
      <div class="hw-section">
        <h2>Why This Hardware Is a Long-Term Bet</h2>
        <p>The direction of AI development is toward local compute. That's not a prediction — it's already happening.</p>
        <p>Models that required a data center two years ago now run on a laptop. Models that required a high-end GPU last year now run on a Mac mini. The trajectory isn't slowing — it's accelerating, and the efficiency curve is moving faster than the capability curve. Every year, meaningfully more capable models fit into meaningfully less compute.</p>
        <p>What this means practically: <strong>the agents running on cloud APIs today will increasingly run on your own hardware.</strong> Faster. With no per-token cost. With no data leaving your machine at all. Apple Silicon is already capable of running serious local models — Llama, Qwen, Phi, Mistral — at speeds that are genuinely useful for production work. The M4 Pro has enough unified memory to hold models that would have required a dedicated GPU rig a year ago.</p>
        <p>Every generation of Apple Silicon meaningfully increases what's possible locally. The machine you buy today will run models next year that don't exist yet — models substantially more capable than what's available now. You're not buying hardware for today's workload. You're buying into a compute architecture that is scaling in exactly the direction this technology is heading.</p>
        <p>When local inference catches up to cloud inference — and it will, for most tasks — the operators already running local infrastructure will have a real advantage. The hardware will be paid for. The system will be configured. The only thing that changes is the model you point it at.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- SECTION: Mac configs + models -->
      <div class="hw-section">
        <h2>What Each Machine Can Run</h2>
        <p>Not all Apple Silicon is equal for local inference. Memory is the binding constraint — models need to fit in unified RAM to run at usable speeds. Here's how the current Mac lineup maps to real models:</p>

        <table class="comparison-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Machine</th>
              <th>RAM</th>
              <th>Price</th>
              <th>Models that run well</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Mac mini M4</td>
              <td>16GB</td>
              <td>$599–$799</td>
              <td>Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B, Gemma 7B, Phi-3 Mini/Small — solid for cloud-API workflows with occasional local inference</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Mac mini M4 <span class="verdict-tag recommended">Our pick</span></td>
              <td>24GB</td>
              <td>$999</td>
              <td>All of the above + Llama 3.1 8B at full speed, Qwen 14B, Phi-3 Medium — handles a full production stack without hitting limits</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Mac mini M4 Pro</td>
              <td>24GB</td>
              <td>$1,299</td>
              <td>Same model range as 24GB M4 but faster throughput — better for parallel agent workloads hitting local models simultaneously</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Mac mini M4 Pro</td>
              <td>48GB</td>
              <td>$1,599</td>
              <td>Llama 3.1 70B Q4, Qwen 32B, Mixtral 8×7B — first tier where 70B models run comfortably</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Mac Studio M4 Max</td>
              <td>64–128GB</td>
              <td>$1,999+</td>
              <td>Llama 3.1 70B at full precision, Qwen 72B, Mixtral 8×22B, large multimodal models — up to 2TB storage for keeping multiple large models on-device</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>For most deployments, the 24GB M4 mini hits the right balance. The jump to 48GB only makes sense once you're specifically trying to run 70B-class models locally. Below 16GB, you're constrained to smaller models and mostly relying on cloud APIs for heavier inference.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- RECOMMENDATION BLOCK -->
      <div class="rec-block">
        <div class="rec-label">Our Recommendation</div>
        <div class="rec-title">Mac mini M4 or M4 Pro</div>
        <p class="rec-body">For most small teams and individuals, this is the right machine. It's quiet enough for a bedroom or home office, powerful enough to handle serious production workloads, and priced well for the value it delivers. The M4 starts at $599 — but the sweet spot is the $999 configuration: 24GB of unified memory and 512GB of storage. That's what we used to build this company, and it handles a full production agent stack without breaking a sweat. Step up to the M4 Pro (starting at $1,299) if you're planning to run larger local models or heavier parallel workloads.</p>
        <p class="rec-body">If you need maximum headroom — large model weights stored on-device, a multi-agent setup running at scale, or up to 2TB of internal storage — the <strong>Mac Studio M4 Max</strong> is worth the jump. It starts at $1,999 and scales up from there. More than most people need, but the right call if you're building something serious.</p>
        <p class="rec-body"><strong>If budget is the primary constraint,</strong> a Linux machine or VPS is a workable path. We've deployed on both. It works. It just takes more time to set up and maintain — and you'll want to be comfortable in the terminal before going that route.</p>
        <p class="rec-body">If you're already in the Apple ecosystem, the integration advantages are real. If you're not, this is a reasonable reason to start.</p>
