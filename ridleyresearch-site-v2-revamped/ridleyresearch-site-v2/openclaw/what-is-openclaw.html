      <h1>What is OpenClaw?</h1>
      <p class="muted">OpenClaw section · 4 min read</p>

      <p>Most AI tools are applications. You open them, you type something, you get a response, you close them. They don't remember what you did yesterday. They don't run while you sleep. They don't connect to your other tools. Every session starts from zero.</p>

      <p>OpenClaw is different. It's an <strong>AI agent operating system</strong> — a layer that runs continuously on your own machine and coordinates AI models, tools, schedules, and memory into a working system that actually operates on your behalf.</p>

      <h2>Not a Chatbot. An Operator.</h2>

      <p>A chatbot answers questions. An agent takes actions. The distinction matters more than it sounds.</p>

      <p>When you ask a chatbot to summarize your emails, it tells you how you could do it. When an agent handles email triage, it reads your inbox at 7 AM, classifies every message, drafts responses to the routine ones, and delivers a prioritized summary to your phone — without you initiating anything. The work happened while you were asleep.</p>

      <p>OpenClaw is the infrastructure that makes that second scenario possible. It coordinates:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI models</strong> — cloud (Claude, GPT-4) and local (Llama, Qwen, Phi) — routed to the right task</li>
        <li><strong>Tools</strong> — file operations, web search, email, calendar, messaging, code execution</li>
        <li><strong>Schedules</strong> — cron jobs that run recurring tasks automatically</li>
        <li><strong>Memory</strong> — persistent context that carries forward across sessions</li>
        <li><strong>Skills</strong> — specialized procedures that load on demand for specific jobs</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>It Runs on Your Machine</h2>

      <p>This is one of the most important properties. OpenClaw installs on your Mac (or Linux machine) and runs as a local service. Your data doesn't transit a third-party platform. Your agent's memory, files, and operating rules stay on hardware you control.</p>

      <p>For anyone handling sensitive client data, this isn't optional. That data can't live in a SaaS vendor's database. OpenClaw's local-first architecture is what makes it the right call for operators who take data control seriously.</p>

      <p>It connects to the outside world when you tell it to — for research, for sending messages, for calling APIs. But the orchestration layer, the memory, the files, and the agent's identity all stay local.</p>

      <h2>The Interface is Wherever You Are</h2>

      <p>You interact with OpenClaw through Telegram (or other messaging platforms). That means your agent is reachable from your phone, your laptop, anywhere — without opening a specific app or logging into a specific dashboard. You send a message. The agent handles it.</p>

      <p>The same goes for outbound communication: the agent can send you a morning briefing, alert you when a job fails, or ask for approval before taking an external action — all through the same channel.</p>

      <h2>What it's Good At</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Scheduled automation — jobs that run on a timer without you initiating them</li>
        <li>Research and synthesis — gather, process, and summarize information from multiple sources</li>
        <li>Memory — remember context, decisions, and preferences across every session</li>
        <li>Document work — draft, edit, format, and save files</li>
        <li>Communication — draft and stage outbound messages for approval</li>
        <li>Coordination — run sub-agents in parallel, verify outputs, report results</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What it's Not</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>It's not a search engine</li>
        <li>It's not a voice assistant</li>
        <li>It's not a no-code tool with a drag-and-drop interface</li>
        <li>It's not a SaaS subscription that someone else hosts</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There's a learning curve. The people getting the most value from it are operators who are willing to configure it, test it, and treat it like infrastructure — not like an app they downloaded.</p>
