      <h2>The Problem</h2>

      <p>Ask any salesperson what they actually do with their day and they'll tell you: maybe two hours of real selling. The rest is everything else. Updating the CRM after every call. Writing follow-up emails that say roughly the same thing each time with the names swapped. Digging through a spreadsheet to figure out who hasn't heard from you in two weeks. Building proposal decks from scratch because you don't have a good template. Chasing down DocuSign links. Logging activity.</p>

      <p>None of that is selling. And the brutal part is that it has to get done — a deal that isn't followed up on dies, a contact that isn't logged disappears, a proposal that takes four days to build costs you the close. So it's not optional admin. It's necessary admin that happens to devour the time you're supposed to be spending on revenue.</p>

      <p>The highest performers find ways to compress it — better templates, a disciplined CRM hygiene practice, batching their follow-ups. But they're still doing it manually. They've optimized around the problem instead of removing it. There's a difference.</p>

      <h2>What Changes</h2>

      <p>A custom agent setup built for how your sales process actually runs changes the math on what requires your attention versus what can run without you.</p>

      <p>Take follow-up. Instead of remembering who needs to hear from you and writing individual messages, an agent monitors your pipeline, identifies contacts past a certain threshold with no activity, drafts a follow-up in your voice based on where the deal stands, and queues it for your review. You read it, approve it, send it. The writing and the tracking happened automatically. You made the call.</p>

      <p>Proposal prep works the same way. You close a discovery call and drop a few notes. The agent pulls from your service descriptions, pricing structure, and client context to assemble a first draft. You refine it. It's not going to replace your judgment on how to structure a deal — but it eliminates the blank-page problem that costs you an hour every time.</p>

      <p>Post-call CRM updates, meeting recaps, LinkedIn research before a first call, scheduling coordination — all of it compressible. Not eliminated, but handled at a level where your involvement is a final check, not full manual execution.</p>

      <h2>What "Custom" Actually Means</h2>

      <p>There's no package here. We don't have a "Salesperson AI Kit" that we install and hand you. What we do is learn how your sales process works — your CRM, your follow-up cadence, how you write, what your proposals look like, what your pipeline stages are — and build agents around that. The output is a system that fits the way you actually sell, not a generic automation you have to adapt yourself to.</p>

      <p>The distinction matters because most salespeople have tried generic AI tools and found them mostly useless for their actual workflow. The writing is wrong. The CRM integration doesn't work the way they need it to. The context is missing. A custom build solves for all of that because it's built specifically for your process, your language, your setup.</p>

      <h2>The Result</h2>

      <p>Your follow-up doesn't slip because you were busy. Your pipeline stays current without a two-hour Friday CRM session. Proposals go out the same day as the discovery call instead of three days later. You spend your actual selling time on calls, on closes, on relationships — the things no agent can do for you.</p>

      <p>The week looks different. Not because you're working harder but because more of your hours are going toward the thing that actually moves deals forward.</p>
