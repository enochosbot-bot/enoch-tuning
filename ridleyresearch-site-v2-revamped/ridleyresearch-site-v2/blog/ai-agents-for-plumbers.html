      <h2>The Problem</h2>

      <p>If you run a plumbing company — even a small one with a few trucks — you already know that being a plumber is actually the easier part of the job. The harder part is running the business around it. Every day there's a stack of phone calls to return, estimates to write up, invoices to chase, appointments to confirm, and reviews to respond to. None of it makes you money directly. All of it has to happen.</p>

      <p>Most owner-operators handle it the same way: phone never leaves their pocket, texts answered between jobs, QuickBooks open at the kitchen table after dinner. It works until it doesn't — until you're underwater on a big job and two days of voicemails pile up, or an estimate you forgot to follow up on went to a competitor because you didn't circle back in time.</p>

      <p>The margin on residential service work is tight enough that losing jobs to poor follow-up is a real problem. A missed callback, an estimate that sat in someone's inbox for a week without a nudge, an invoice that didn't get sent until a month after the job — these are small failures that add up to a measurable hole in your revenue. You're not losing business because of your work quality. You're losing it because the business side doesn't run as tight as the field side.</p>

      <h2>What Changes</h2>

      <p>A custom agent setup built for a plumbing business handles the back-office operations that are currently living in your head and your phone.</p>

      <p>New estimate requests get acknowledged immediately — a confirmation sent so the customer knows you got their message, with a realistic window for when they'll hear back. The estimate itself gets drafted from your pricing structure and job notes, formatted consistently, and sent on your behalf. Your techs' schedules get confirmed the night before. Customers get a reminder an hour before their appointment window. After the job closes, the invoice goes out the same day. Two weeks later, a follow-up goes out asking for a review.</p>

      <p>None of that requires you to sit down and do it manually. It runs on a schedule, driven by what's in your job management system, and anything that needs your actual decision sits in a queue for when you have two minutes between jobs.</p>

      <p>Seasonal campaigns — water heater service reminders before winter, drain maintenance in spring — go out to your customer list without you planning them from scratch each year. Your past customers stay in contact with your business instead of Googling a competitor the next time something goes wrong.</p>

      <h2>What "Custom" Actually Means</h2>

      <p>Every plumbing business runs differently. Some do residential service only. Some mix in commercial work. Some have two techs and a dispatcher, some are owner-operator with one helper. Your pricing structure, your service area, how you communicate with customers, what software you use to manage jobs — all of it is specific to you.</p>

      <p>We build around your setup, not a generic template. Before we build anything, we understand how your business actually works — what's falling through the cracks, where you're losing time, how you want to communicate with customers. The agents we configure fit your workflow. When it's running, it feels like an extension of how you already operate, not something foreign that you have to maintain.</p>

      <h2>The Result</h2>

      <p>Estimates go out faster. Follow-ups actually happen. Invoices don't pile up. Your customer list stays warm. You stop losing jobs to the gap between when someone called and when you got back to them.</p>

      <p>The field work doesn't change. The business around it runs cleaner, with less of it sitting on your shoulders at 9 PM.</p>
