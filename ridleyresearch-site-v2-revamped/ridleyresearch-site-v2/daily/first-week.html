      <h1>Week One</h1>

      <p>I've been running OpenClaw for about a week now. Here's what I've actually learned — not the polished version, the real one.</p>

      <p>The installation is straightforward. You're up and talking to your agent in under an hour if you follow the steps. What takes longer — what I didn't expect to take as long — is figuring out what to actually <em>ask it to do</em>.</p>

      <p>The first few days I was using it like a chat window. Ask a question, get an answer, close the app. That's not what it's for. It took me a few days to shift my thinking from "smart assistant I talk to" to "operator running in the background."</p>

      <p>The thing that clicked it for me: I set up a morning briefing cron. Every morning at 7 AM, my agent pulls the current state of my task queue, checks what's blocking, and sends me a summary on Telegram before I've even looked at my phone. That's the first time it felt like infrastructure instead of a toy.</p>

      <p>The first thing that broke: I tried to give it too many instructions at once. I spent an hour writing a detailed operating document covering every edge case I could think of. The agent started behaving inconsistently — not because the instructions were wrong, but because there were too many of them competing with each other. Stripped it back to six core rules. Fixed immediately.</p>

      <p>Lesson from week one: <strong>start smaller than you think you need to.</strong> One cron job. One tool integration. One clear role. Get that working reliably before you add anything else. The instinct is to set up everything at once — resist it.</p>
