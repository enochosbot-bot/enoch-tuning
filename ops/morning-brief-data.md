# Morning Brief Data — 2026-02-28 03:15 AM CST

## API Usage
*Cost report script not found at workspace/scripts/daily-cost-report.py — skipped. Review cost infrastructure.*

## Overnight Work
- **Memory System Migration (02:00-02:32 AM):** Completed full migration from workspace/memory/ to Obsidian. Deleted workspace memory/ directory entirely.

Obsidian is now single source of truth for all persistent memory.
