## Post 1 — AI displacement (Panic bucket)
> The clients asking "will AI replace my advisor?" are the same ones who asked if Robinhood was going to replace us in 2017.
> 
> It didn't. Because markets don't need execution. They need judgment under uncertainty.
> 
> That's still a human job.

---

## Post 2 — OpenClaw / AI OS (Business bucket)
> Most advisors are still copying data between five tabs manually.
> 
> We're not.
> 
> The gap between firms using AI as infrastructure and firms using it as a buzzword is about to get very wide.

## Post 3 — Practitioner take (Hype/grounding bucket)
> "AI can replace a financial advisor" assumes the job is information retrieval.
> 
> The job is helping someone not panic-sell in March 2020.
> 
> Different skill set.

---

## Post 4 — Short / punchy (Business bucket)
> The best AI deployment I've seen in financial services isn't a chatbot.
> 
> It's an agent that handles all the administrative drag so the advisor can spend three more hours a week actually talking to clients.
> 
> Boring. Effective.

## Post 5 — CFP / expertise signal (Authority bucket)
> Everyone's building AI tools for advisors.
> 
> Most of them are solving the wrong problem.
> 
> The bottleneck isn't information. It's trust. Build for that.
