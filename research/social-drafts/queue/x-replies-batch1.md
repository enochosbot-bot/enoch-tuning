## REPLY SET A — "AI will replace everyone" discourse
*Use on: any post claiming AI will replace all workers, all jobs, etc.*

> AI won't replace most people.
>
> It will replace the parts of their job they were doing badly anyway.
>
> The question isn't whether you'll be replaced. It's whether you're spending your time on things only you can do.

---

## REPLY SET B — SaaS "the future of software" takes
*Use on: posts hyping SaaS products, AI-wrapped SaaS, "just use our tool" content*

> The best AI stack most small businesses could run isn't a SaaS product.
>
> It's an agent on their own machine that doesn't send their data anywhere, costs nothing per month, and actually knows how their business works.
>
> SaaS solved distribution. It didn't solve fit.

---

## REPLY SET C — "AI is too complicated for small businesses" takes
*Use on: posts claiming AI is enterprise-only or too complex for regular people*

> The gap isn't technical. It's that most AI tools are built for enterprises and sold downmarket.
>
> A bootstrapper doesn't need a platform. They need one workflow that handles the thing eating their time.
>
> Different problem, different solution.

---

## REPLY SET D — Layoff discourse
*Use on: posts about tech layoffs, "AI caused layoffs," jobs being automated*

> The people getting replaced aren't being replaced by AI.
>
> They're being replaced by the people who figured out how to use AI to do what three people used to do.
>
> That's always been how leverage works. The tool changes. The dynamic doesn't.

---

## REPLY SET E — "Agents are overhyped" contrarian takes
*Use on: posts dismissing AI agents as hype or not ready*

> Agents aren't overhyped. Specific implementations are.
>
> The difference between hype and real: does it run while you sleep, make decisions without prompting, and actually reduce your workload?
>
> If you've only seen demos, you haven't seen agents.

---

## REPLY SET F — Productivity porn / hustle culture
*Use on: posts about working harder, grinding, doing more*

> The bottleneck for most small business owners isn't effort.
>
> It's that they're spending half their hours on $15/hr work because they can't afford to hire for it yet.
>
> That's a leverage problem, not a discipline problem.

---

## REPLY SET G — OpenClaw mentions
*Use on: any post mentioning OpenClaw directly*

> The part most people miss with OpenClaw is that the model is the least interesting piece.
>
> The memory architecture, the agent routing, the ops layer — that's where the leverage actually comes from.
>
> Most installs treat it like a chatbot. That's leaving most of it on the table.
