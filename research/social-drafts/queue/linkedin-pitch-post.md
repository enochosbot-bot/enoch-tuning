Everyone running a business has a category of work they hate and are bad at.

For most people it's the admin layer — email, follow-up, scheduling, proposals, the stuff that sits between you and the work you actually do well.

Most people push through it. Get faster at it. Hire someone to do it eventually.

There's a third option: build an agent that handles it.

At Ridley Research, we build AI operating systems for individuals and small businesses. Persistent agents that run your back office while you focus on the work that actually moves the needle.

Not a chatbot. Not a SaaS subscription. A system built around how you operate, deployed on your own machine.

If you're spending hours on work that doesn't need to be yours — that's the problem we solve.
