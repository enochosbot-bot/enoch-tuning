## Notes on Content Architecture

The church website itself has **3 blog posts** — all from 2014, announcement-style only. The primary ongoing content output is **Generations Radio**, a daily podcast hosted by lead pastor Kevin Swanson. The church explicitly sponsors the program: "The church has sponsored this radio program for the last four years." Available via SermonAudio at: https://www.sermonaudio.com/solo/generations

The Sermon Archive page at reformationchurch.com/sermon-archive/ exists but loads content dynamically via a SermonAudio JavaScript widget (cannot be scraped via curl). For current church sermons, access SermonAudio directly.
