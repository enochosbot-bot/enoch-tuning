# Theological Positions Brief — Reformation Church of Elizabeth
**Date compiled:** 2026-02-26  
**Lead pastor:** Kevin Swanson (ordained 2002; daily radio host, Generations Radio)  
**Website:** https://www.reformationchurch.com  
**Denomination:** Covenant Presbyterian Church (CPC)

---

## Core Commitments

1. **Confessional Reformed/Presbyterian** — explicit subscription to the Westminster Confession of Faith and Westminster Larger/Shorter Catechisms by all teachers. Not vaguely "Reformed-ish" — this is hard confessionalism.

2. **Sola Scriptura with practical application** — Scripture is not just a doctrinal source; it governs "every area of life" (their phrase). The Word of God is to be applied comprehensively to family, education, culture, and politics.

3. **Presbyterian polity** — governed by elders (plural). Ruling and teaching elders. Member of the Covenant Presbyterian Church (CPC), a small confessional Presbyterian denomination.

4. **Covenant theology** — Reformed covenant framework (covenant of works → covenant of grace). Children of believers are covenant members; hence paedobaptism.

5. **Regulative Principle of Worship (RPW)** — worship is governed only by what Scripture commands, not by what Scripture merely permits. This rules out drama, puppet shows, most contemporary worship music, and entertainment-driven church. Explicitly stated.

6. **Psalm-singing tradition** — the church sings the Psalms as part of its worship. This is a notable Reformed minority practice (exclusive or near-exclusive psalmody) that most evangelical churches have abandoned.

## Soteriology (Salvation)

**Framework:** Five-Point Calvinism (TULIP) — explicitly signaled by "gospel of sovereign grace" language in their mission statement (Eph. 1:6; 2:8-10).

**T — Total Depravity:** Man is radically corrupted by the Fall; cannot choose God apart from regeneration. All areas of life (mind, will, affections) are affected.

**U — Unconditional Election:** God elects individuals for salvation according to his sovereign will alone, not based on foreseen faith or merit (WCF Ch. III).

**L — Limited (Definite) Atonement:** Christ's atoning work is specifically for the elect; his death actually accomplishes salvation for those the Father gave him, not merely makes it possible for all.

**I — Irresistible Grace:** The Holy Spirit's effectual calling cannot be permanently resisted by the elect. Regeneration precedes and produces faith.

**P — Perseverance of the Saints:** Those whom God has truly saved will not finally fall away. Assurance is possible; apostasy of the truly regenerate is impossible.

**Justification:** By faith alone (sola fide) in Christ's righteousness imputed to the believer. Works do not contribute to justification. Sanctification (growth in holiness) follows necessarily.

**Confidence level:** High. "Sovereign grace" = standard Calvinist code. WCF subscription confirms all five points.

## Ecclesiology (Church)

**Church government:** Presbyterian — rule by elders (plural). Teaching elders (pastors) preach and teach. Ruling elders oversee the flock. Deacons handle mercy ministry. This structure is explicitly evidenced in their leadership page (3 pastors + 4 deacons).

**Membership:** Church membership is required for accountability. Members covenant to answer 5 questions: affirm Scripture as God's Word, affirm the Triune God, affirm Christ as Savior, accept Christ as Lord, and submit to local church oversight.

**Sacraments (2):**
- *Baptism* — administered to infants of believers (paedobaptism). Covenant children are part of the visible church from birth. This is the standard Presbyterian position, distinct from Baptist/Anabaptist practice.
- *Lord's Supper* — celebrated weekly. Open to "believers accountable to a local church" — a semi-close communion position (requires credible profession + church accountability, but not specific denomination membership).

**Worship standard:** Regulative Principle of Worship. Worship content is derived from Scripture's positive commands, not human tradition or preference. No drama, entertainment, or culturally-driven elements.

**Children in worship:** Children stay with parents through the entire service (family-integrated worship). No children's church or age-segregated programming. A cry room is provided for infants.

**Denomination:** Covenant Presbyterian Church (CPC) — described as "committed to doctrinal purity, faithful worship, and the Presbyterian form of church government." Small confessional body; not affiliated with PCA, OPC, RPCNA, or NAPARC.

**Confidence level:** High. All confirmed from FAQ and What to Expect pages.

## Political Theology (if any)

**Status: Significant, though not formally codified on the church website. Heavily developed through Generations Radio.**

**Core framework:** Christ is Lord over ALL of life — not just the private sphere. From the FAQ: "He is our Lord and King, and that means He has the right to tell us what to do." This is a Kuyperian/Calvinist "sphere sovereignty" framework applied to politics, education, culture, and economics.

**Key themes from Generations Radio content:**

- **Anti-tyranny / Pro-God's law over civil law:** Multiple episodes on resisting tyranny, constitutional limits of executive power, and John Knox's resistance theory (interview with Jacob Tanner). Reference: "How To Resist Tyranny & Obey God" (2026-02-09)

- **Christian nationalism, broadly defined:** Episodes engage explicitly with Christian nationalist questions — kinism, ICE and immigration, MLK Day, rebuilding Western civilization. Not fringe: mainstream engagement from a confessional Reformed perspective. Reference: "What does the Bible say about Kinism?" (2026-01-28); "Can Western Civilization Be Rebuilt?" with Doug Wilson (2026-01-07)

- **Critique of state expansion:** "The church and the family have been marginalized, slowly replaced by the state over the last 150 years." Explicitly stated on the What to Expect page. Opposition to government control of education (homeschooling vouchers episode, 2026-01-26).

- **Postmillennial Kingdom orientation:** Language throughout Generations Radio about "building the kingdom," reforming civilization, and the long-arc rebuilding of Christian influence. Swanson interviews Doug Wilson on civilizational rebuilding. This suggests postmillennial or "optimistic amillennial" eschatology, though not formally stated.

- **Sexual ethics:** Strict complementarian + patriarchal. Multiple episodes on patriarchy, father-led households, rejection of transgenderism (SCOTUS transgender case, 2026-01-20).

- **God's law applied to economics:** Multiple episodes on debt, inflation, economic collapse through a biblical lens.

**Westminster Confession of Faith XXIII (Civil Magistrate):** The WCF affirms civil magistrates are ordained by God, accountable to His law, and their authority is real but limited. The American Revision of the WCF softened language about magistrates maintaining true religion — confessional churches sometimes reject this revision.

**Confidence level:** High for framework; Medium-High for specific positions (derived from podcast content, not formal church position statement).

## Notable Distinctives

1. **Hard confessionalism** — Westminster Standards subscription by all teachers. This is not typical of generic evangelical or even most "Reformed" churches. The WCF is treated as a binding doctrinal standard, not merely a historical document.

2. **Psalm-singing** — The church sings the Psalms as God-inspired songs. This places them in the tradition of the Scottish Covenanters, the RPCNA, and a minority of confessional Presbyterians who hold that the psalter is the God-given hymnal for the church. Most evangelical and even PCA/OPC churches have largely abandoned this practice.

3. **Family-integrated worship** — No age-segregated children's programs. Children stay with their parents through the full service. This is a countercultural stance against the dominant Sunday School/children's church model. The church believes the family (not the church staff) is the primary discipleship unit.

4. **Homeschooling as theological conviction** — The church strongly encourages Christian home education as a biblical mandate (Deut. 6:6-9). Pastor Kevin Swanson was Executive Director of Christian Home Educators of Colorado (1999–2010). Families from across a large geographic radius (Colorado Springs to Aurora) have historically attended because of this emphasis.

5. **Cultural engagement at the political level** — Unlike pietist Reformed churches that focus exclusively on private/church life, this church (through Swanson and Generations Radio) engages directly with politics, elections, cultural decline, and questions of governance from a biblical worldview.

6. **Notable connections:** Kevin Swanson has hosted/interviewed Doug Wilson (Christ Church, Moscow, ID; Canon Press). This places the church within the orbit of the Federal Vision-adjacent, postmillennial, "Christian civilization" wing of Reformed evangelicalism.

7. **Anti-state-education posture** — The church building project was partly motivated by the fact that "political pressures and shifting worldviews" made renting public school facilities "increasingly more difficult." The church sees the public school system as hostile to Christian formation.

## Useful for Deacon's Content

**5 theological arguments/talking points from this church's content that translate well to YouTube Shorts / social media for a faith+politics audience:**

### 1. "Christ is King — Including Over Your Government"
**Source:** FAQ ("He is our Lord and King, and that means He has the right to tell us what to do") + WCF XXIII  
**Hook:** Christians are told to "stay out of politics," but the Westminster Confession says the civil magistrate is accountable to God. You don't get to opt out of Christ's lordship when you walk into the Capitol.  
**Content angle:** Short theological primer on why political neutrality is not a Christian option. Drops into Christian nationalism conversation naturally.

### 2. "Sovereign Grace vs. Self-Made Faith"
**Source:** Eph. 1:6; 2:8-10 (cited in mission statement); TULIP doctrine  
**Hook:** Most American Christianity is functionally Arminian — you choose God, you make a decision, you decide to be saved. Scripture says God chose you before the foundation of the world.  
**Content angle:** Doctrines of grace explainer. Highly shareable among Reformed/Calvinist communities. Cuts against both moralistic therapeutic deism and shallow evangelicalism.

### 3. "The State Has Replaced the Family — And the Church Let It Happen"
**Source:** What to Expect page (explicitly stated); Generations Radio (homeschool voucher episode, tyranny episode)  
**Hook:** For 150 years the government has been slowly taking over functions God gave to families and churches — welfare, education, healthcare, elderly care. And Christians cheered. Time to reclaim what was stolen.  
**Content angle:** Cultural critique + call to action. Applies to homeschooling, church benevolence, local community, anti-statist political theology. Strong YouTube Shorts format.

### 4. "No Gospel Without Courage"
**Source:** Generations Radio: "What Does the Bible Say About Courage?" (2026-02-11) + pattern across multiple episodes  
**Hook:** During COVID, much of the church shut up and complied. Scripture does not treat cowardice lightly. The fear of man is a snare. Biblical courage is not a personality trait — it's a fruit of fearing God more than men.  
**Content angle:** Direct challenge to the soft, conflict-avoidant evangelical church. Faith + politics audience reacts strongly to "the church failed" narratives.

### 5. "Rebuild the West — Or Watch It Burn"
**Source:** "Can Western Civilization Be Rebuilt?" with Doug Wilson (2026-01-07); "2026 Forecast" (2026-01-05); "Warning Signs for Tyranny" (2026-02-05)  
**Hook:** The Doug Wilson angle: "God is rearranging the landscape for the sake of His church." The West isn't just declining — it's being cleared for something new. The question is whether Christians will be the builders or the observers.  
**Content angle:** Postmillennial hope + civilizational vision. Pairs perfectly with Christian nationalism content. Doug Wilson name-drop also drives search traffic within the Reformed community.
