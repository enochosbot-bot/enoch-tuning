## Overview

Reformation Church of Elizabeth is a **confessional Reformed/Presbyterian church** that explicitly subscribes to the **Westminster Confession of Faith (WCF)** and the **Westminster Larger and Shorter Catechisms** as their subordinate standards. They also affirm the **Apostles Creed** and the **Nicene Creed** as summaries of the historic Christian faith. Their doctrinal positions are fully derived from these documents, not from an independent statement of faith. Below, each doctrine is summarized per WCF + confirmed by site language.

> **Distinctive flag:** This is a Westminster-standards confessional church. Every doctrinal position below is derived from the WCF + confirmed against site language. Where a position is only inferred from the WCF (not explicitly restated on the site), this is flagged.

## 1. Scripture (Holy Bible)

**Position:** The Bible is the infallible, inspired Word of God — the supreme rule of faith and practice. Scripture is sufficient; nothing is to be added.

**Key Scripture:** 2 Tim. 3:16–17; 2 Pet. 1:20–21; Acts 17:11 (cited directly in their mission statement)

**Summary:** The church explicitly cites Acts 17:11 ("examining the scriptures daily") in their mission statement and states they preach the Bible "every Lord's Day." Their FAQ says they take Christ as "the ultimate prophet who spoke the truth" — all doctrine is to be derived from Scripture, not tradition or experience.

**Distinctive:** WCF Chapter I holds Scripture's authority is self-authenticating (autopistia), not dependent on the Church's endorsement. This is a sharp anti-Catholic/anti-liberal position. Church website strongly emphasizes Scripture's relevance "in all of life" — theonomy-adjacent, not just pietism. *[Explicitly stated on site]*

## 2. God (Doctrine of God / Theology Proper)

**Position:** One God in three Persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) — the Triune God of the Nicene and Apostles Creeds. Eternal, omnipotent, sovereign, holy.

**Key Scripture:** Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14; Exod. 20:4-6 (cited on site)

**Summary:** Church affirms both ecumenical creeds in full. Their membership vows explicitly ask, "Do you believe in the Triune God?" WCF Chapter II: God is "infinite in being and perfection," "most holy," "most absolute," and "most sovereign." Exod. 20:4-6 cited in their mission statement ("Keep God central in worship, in all of life").

**Distinctive:** WCF includes strong statements on God's sovereignty and **eternal decree** (WCF III: God "unchangeably ordained whatsoever comes to pass") — this is high Calvinist predestination. *[Inferred from WCF subscription; not re-stated explicitly on site]*

---

## 3. Jesus Christ (Christology)

**Position:** Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God, fully God and fully man, born of the virgin Mary, crucified, risen, ascended, and returning to judge.

**Key Scripture:** Full Nicene Creed text reproduced on site; John 1:1–14; Phil. 2:6–11

**Summary:** Church reproduces both the Apostles Creed and Nicene Creed in full on their beliefs page. The FAQ explicitly describes Christ as "the ultimate prophet who spoke the truth," "the ultimate priest, who sacrificed Himself for our sins," and "our Lord and King." This prophet-priest-king schema is classic Reformed Christology (munus triplex).

**Distinctive:** The three-offices schema (prophet, priest, king) and the explicit statement that Christ as King "has the right to tell us what to do" leans toward a **Lordship Salvation / Kuyperian** framework — Christ's sovereignty extends over all of life, not merely the soul. *[Explicitly stated on site]*

---

## 4. Salvation (Soteriology)

**Position:** Salvation is by grace alone (sola gratia), through faith alone (sola fide), in Christ alone (solus Christus). Election is unconditional; calling is effectual. TULIP framework.

**Key Scripture:** Eph. 1:6; 2:8–10 (directly cited in mission statement — "gospel of sovereign grace")

**Summary:** The church's mission statement opens with: "Teach the gospel of sovereign grace in Jesus Christ — Eph. 1:6, 2:8-10." "Sovereign grace" is explicitly Calvinist terminology for the TULIP doctrines of grace. The FAQ states: "The doctrines of Justification by Faith and Salvation by Grace are crucial to the vitality of the Christian Faith." WCF Ch. X–XVII: Effectual calling, justification by faith alone, sanctification, perseverance of the saints.

**Distinctive (Major):** **Five-Point Calvinism (TULIP)** is the unambiguous doctrinal framework:
- **T**otal Depravity — man is radically corrupt by nature
- **U**nconditional Election — God elects by sovereign will, not foreseen faith
- **L**imited Atonement — Christ's atonement is particular/definite (for the elect)
- **I**rresistible Grace — effectual calling cannot be refused by the elect
- **P**erseverance of the Saints — the elect will not finally fall away
*[Explicitly signaled by "sovereign grace" language; fully described in WCF subscription]*

## 5. Church (Ecclesiology)

**Position:** Presbyterian polity (rule by elders). Member of the Covenant Presbyterian Church (CPC). Infant baptism (paedobaptism). Weekly Lord's Supper open to believers accountable to a local church.

**Key Scripture:** Acts 2:41; Acts 20:28; 1 Cor. 5:11–13; Eph. 2:11–13

**Summary:** The church is governed by ruling and teaching elders (Presbyterian polity). The FAQ explicitly cites biblical texts on church membership and elder oversight. Membership requires affirmation of 5 covenant questions including belief in Scripture, the Triune God, Christ as Savior and Lord, and accountability to local church leadership. They hold to a **confessional, visible church** model — membership is necessary for accountability.

**Sacraments:** WCF affirms two sacraments — Baptism and the Lord's Supper. Baptism is administered to infants of believers (paedobaptism), a distinctly Presbyterian position. Communion is weekly, open to "believers accountable to a local church" — this is "close communion" (not fully fenced, but not open table). *[Communion practice explicitly stated; baptism inferred from WCF + Presbyterian polity — not re-stated on site]*

**Distinctive:** Use of **Regulative Principle of Worship (RPW)** — "We will not bring novel elements of worship into his sanctuary such as drama or puppet shows." Worship must be commanded by Scripture, not merely permitted. This is a distinctly Reformed/Presbyterian position that rules out most contemporary church practices. *[Explicitly stated on What to Expect page]*

**Music:** Psalm-singing tradition. The FAQ states: "We sing the psalms…For about 2900 years (until 1900), Christian churches would sing the Psalms." They continue this tradition alongside historic hymns. **Psalm-singing** (at minimum) — this may indicate exclusive or near-exclusive psalmody, which is a distinctive minority Reformed practice. *[Explicitly stated]*

## 6. Eschatology (Last Things)

**Position:** Bodily resurrection of the dead; final judgment by Christ; eternal life for believers; eternal punishment for the wicked.

**Key Scripture:** Nicene Creed: "I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come." WCF XXXII–XXXIII.

**Summary:** The church reproduces the Nicene Creed affirmation of bodily resurrection and final judgment. WCF XXXII: souls of the righteous go to God at death (Westminster Confession does not teach soul sleep); at the last day bodies are raised to be reunited with their souls. WCF XXXIII: Christ returns to judge in glory; the righteous receive eternal life; the wicked receive condemnation.

**Distinctive:** The WCF is compatible with both **amillennialism** and **postmillennialism** (but not premillennial dispensationalism). Kevin Swanson's language on Generations Radio — "Can Western Civilization Be Rebuilt?", references to "building the kingdom," Christian influence over nations and culture — suggests a **postmillennial or kingdom-building orientation**, though not stated explicitly on the church website. *[Eschatological framework inferred from WCF; postmill inclinations inferred from Generations Radio content]*

## 7. Political Theology

**Position:** Not formally stated on website. However, significant directional evidence from site and podcast:

- **Christ's Lordship is universal** — "He is our Lord and King, and that means He has the right to tell us what to do" (FAQ). This extends beyond individual piety to all of life.
- **WCF XXIII (Civil Magistrate):** Magistrates are ordained by God, accountable to His law. The original WCF includes language that magistrates should "maintain" true religion (this was softened in the American revision, but confessional churches often affirm the stronger position).
- **Generations Radio** extensively covers political theology: tyranny, government authority, immigration, cultural decline, Christian nationalism (explicitly: "What does the Bible say about Kinism?", "How to Resist Tyranny & Obey God", "Should We Celebrate MLK Jr.?").
- **Theonomy-adjacent** emphasis on applying God's Word in "all of life" and rebuilding Christian civilization.
- Church explicitly laments the state replacing the church and family over 150 years: "The church and the family have been marginalized, slowly replaced by the state over the last 150 years." *[Explicitly stated on What to Expect page]*
