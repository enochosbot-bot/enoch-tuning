# @sukh_saroy — Financial Datasets MCP Server for Claude

**One-line:** Real MCP server that connects Claude to live stock market data — 30k+ tickers, historical financials, SEC filings, insider transactions.

**Product:** financialdatasets.ai — REST API with MCP wrapper. Related open-source library: github.com/virattt/financial-datasets (generates Q&A datasets from 10-Ks for RAG/fine-tuning).

**Key finding:** Tweet is hype-framed ("🚨 Claude has access to the entire stock market") but the underlying product is legitimate. This is read-only market data access, not trading. Free trial available; paid tiers for scale.

**Spectrum relevance:** Could plug directly into Deacon's Spectrum Advisors AI workflow — client research, portfolio context, insider transaction checks, SEC filing lookups. Demo candidate for internal AI presentation.

**Verdict: READ_DEEPER** — check API pricing and MCP setup docs. Potentially high-value for Spectrum workflow demo.
