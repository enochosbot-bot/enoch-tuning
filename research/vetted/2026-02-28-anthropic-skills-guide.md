# @heyrimsha — Anthropic's Complete Guide to Building Claude Skills

**One-line:** Solid summary of Anthropic's Skills guide — structured SKILL.md files replace ad-hoc prompting with repeatable execution layers.

**Key finding:** Progressive disclosure (YAML frontmatter → full instructions → referenced assets on demand) is the architecture already running in OpenClaw. The MCP-as-kitchen / Skills-as-recipe analogy is clean. Testing emphasis (trigger accuracy, tool efficiency, failure rate, token usage) is worth internalizing for agent design.

**Verdict: READ_DEEPER** — skim the actual guide PDF to tighten Bezzy/Ezra skill file structure. Already living this architecture but could be more intentional about it.
