# @jaxonpoulton — Mass Producing AI Videos ($7k/mo)

**One-line:** Viral engagement bait — 4 sentences + link back to X, no actual playbook shared.

**Key finding:** Classic lead-gen funnel. "People will be pissed I'm sharing this" = copywriting trigger, not a real signal. The $7k/month claim is unverified. Link returns to X thread requiring follow/engagement before content is revealed. Underlying concept (AI video mass production for AdSense/affiliate revenue) is real and worth pursuing — just not via this thread.

**Verdict: ARCHIVE** — don't engage with account. Concept is relevant to Deacon's content monetization goals; see adjacent research for actual strategy.
