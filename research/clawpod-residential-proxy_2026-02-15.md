## What It Is
OpenClaw skill that routes agent browser through Massive's residential proxy network. Real browser + real residential IP = unblockable web access across 195 countries.

## Backed By

## When We'd Need It

- Content pipeline doing research across countries
- Sites with aggressive bot protection (Cloudflare, DataDome)
- Running swarms of sub-agents that each need unique IPs
