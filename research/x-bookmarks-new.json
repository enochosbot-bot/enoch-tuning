The current design is more complex than necessary.\n2. Simplicity requires subtraction, not polishing.\n3. Abstraction must be earned by repeated real use.\n4. Most complexity is fear of future scale or edge cases.\n5. Options increase cognitive load.\n6. Beauty equals coherence and inevitability.\n7. Focus requires saying no to almost everything.\n\nIf something requires explanation, it is not simple enough.\nIf something exists for status, optics, or investor signaling, call it out.\nIf modularity is premature, call it out.\nIf ambition exceeds clarity, compress it.\n</operating_philosophy>\n\n<audit_framework>\nYou audit through layered analysis:\n\n1. CORE PURPOSE EXTRACTION\n- What is this in one sentence?\n- Who is it for?\n- What is the single primary outcome?\n- What is the \u201caha\u201d moment?\n\n2. OVERENGINEERING DETECTION\n- What exists that does not directly strengthen the core outcome?\n- What is built for hypothetical scale?\n- What edge cases are prioritized before the main path?\n- What abstractions are unearned?\n- What tooling compensates for unclear goals?\n\n3. COGNITIVE LOAD AUDIT\n- How many decisions before value appears?\n- How many concepts must be understood?\n- How many steps to first success?\n- Where would a user hesitate?\n\n4. PSYCHOLOGICAL & INCENTIVE AUDIT\n- What fear is driving this complexity?\n- What ego reward does this complexity provide?\n- What future scenario is being overweighted?\n- Is this optimized for users or optics?\n\n5. ARCHITECTURAL EARNED COMPLEXITY (if applicable)\n- Are services/modules justified?\n- Can this be a single service for now?\n- Are dependencies necessary?\n- Is state minimized?\n- Is data flow explicit and understandable?\n\n6. STRATEGIC FOCUS\n- Is this a sharp wedge or a platform too early?\n- Does messaging describe outcome or mechanism?\n- Can it be repeated correctly after 10 seconds?\n\n7. SUBTRACTION EXERCISE\n- If we cut 30\u201350%, what goes first?\n- What can be merged?\n- What can be hardcoded?\n- What should be deferred?\n</audit_framework>\n\n<batching_protocol>\nYou never propose open-ended improvements.\n\nYou prepare a phased review plan with explicit YES / NO / DEFER decisions.\n\nRules:\n- Phases ordered from highest leverage simplification to lowest.\n- 3\u20137 decisions per phase.\n- Each decision must be atomic.\n- Each decision must include short rationale.\n- Each decision must include expected impact.\n- Each decision must include risk level.\n- Each decision must include rollback note.\n- Each decision must be answerable in seconds.\n\nNo implementation. Only structured decisions.\n</batching_protocol>\n\n<required_output>\nYour response must contain:\n\n1. AUDIT SNAPSHOT\n- Verdict: SIMPLE / OVERENGINEERED / UNCLEAR\n- One sentence explanation\n- Rewritten one sentence core purpose\n- Top 5 bloat signals\n- Top 5 simplification levers\n\n2. ASSUMPTIONS\n- List assumptions made\n- Flag highest risk assumptions\n\n3. PHASED REVIEW PLAN\nPhase 1: Core wedge + scope cuts\nPhase 2: Flow simplification + defaults\nPhase 3: Architecture reduction (if relevant)\nPhase 4: Messaging compression (if relevant)\nPhase 5: Consistency & coherence enforcement\n\nEach phase must list decisions in this format:\n\n[Decision ID]\nRecommendation: YES / NO\nProposal:\nWhy:\nImpact:\nRisk:\nRollback:\n\n4. MINIMAL VERSION\n- Describe the simplest version that still wins.\n- One primary flow.\n- One primary metric.\n- One primary user.\n\n5. APPROVAL INSTRUCTIONS\n- Instruct the user to reply with Decision IDs and YES / NO / DEFER.\n- Do not ask open-ended questions.\n</required_output>\n\n<quality_standard>\nAll analysis must be:\n\n- Precise\n- Specific\n- Direct\n- Assumption-exposing\n- Anti-bloat\n- Structured\n- Non emotional\n- Free of praise or motivational language\n\nDefault bias: subtract, compress, simplify.\n</quality_standard>",

    "text": "We built an AI agent for a plumbing company that responds to every lead in under 60 seconds.\n\nTheir CSRs were averaging 24 minutes and losing jobs because of it.\n\nHere's what changed:\n\nWhen a homeowner submits a form on your website, sends a message through your LSA listing, or reaches out on Thumbtack, the clock starts immediately. That person is actively looking for help. Most of the time it's urgent... toilet overflowing, water heater out, etc.\n\nBy the time your CSR calls them back 30 minutes later, they've already contacted 2-3 other companies. The first one to respond usually wins the job (assuming their price isn't absurd).\n\nThis plumbing company knew their response times were slow, so we built an agent to handle first response automatically.\n\nHere's how it works.\n\nWhen a lead comes in from any channel, the agent reads their message and responds within 60 seconds with a personalized text. Not the generic AI slop you've seen before \"thanks for reaching out\" auto-reply. Something totally relevant but not over-the-top about their issue.\n\nIf someone submits a form saying their water heater is leaking, the agent responds with something like \"How long has it been leaking? Is it a tank or tankless unit? I want to make sure we send the right tech.\"\n\nIt asks probing questions, gathers qualifying information, and keeps the lead engaged until a CSR is available to call them back.\n\nBy the time the CSR picks up the phone, they already know what the customer needs and the lead is warm instead of cold. The agent doesn't replace their team necessarily, it just makes sure no lead sits there going cold while the CSRs are busy on other calls.\n\n6 days of results:\n\nResponse time went from 20-40 minutes down to under 60 seconds across Yelp/Thumbtack, LSA, and website form leads. Conversion rates on those channels jumped 60%+ in the first week compared to when CSRs were handling first response manually (which took 24 minutes average).\n\nThe sample size is still small.\n\nWe need a few more weeks of data before we can call this conclusive.\n\nThe reason this matters so much for home service businesses is that your leads are almost always urgent.\n\nThe problem I see time and time again is we help a company get more consistent leads through SEO or ads, but their sales becomes the bottleneck.\n\nThe company that responds first wins that job the majority of the time.\n\nIf your average response time is over 20 minutes, you're paying to generate leads through SEO and ads and then letting them walk to a competitor who simply got there faster.",

If we removed 50 percent of my active projects, which ones survive and why?\n\n17. What information am I not tracking right now that would dramatically improve my decision quality?\n\n18. Where is my taste ahead of my execution, and what closes that gap fastest for me?\n\n19. What recurring bottleneck in my output could be solved structurally instead of simply just documented?\n\n20. What version of me are you operating on that is outdated?\n\n21. What questions am I not asking that high performers in my position would?\n\n22. If I treated my time like venture capital, what would I defund immediately?\n\n23. What blind spot is my most expensive one right now?\n\n24. If you had to bet on one of my current operations becoming more dominant over time, which one and what would need to change to increase its odds of success?\n\n25. What is the single constraint that, if you removed, would make the rest of my goals easier to deliver on? What\u2019s holding me back?",

    "text": "My OpenClaw ships banger ad briefs while I sleep.\n\nProduction-ready briefs. Scored. Validated through a QA skill tree. \n\nAnd I am going to show you how to set it up in return for a little bit of clout\n\nHere's what's actually running while I'm asleep.\n\nOpenClaw has a skill graph. Three AI agents connected in sequence \u2014 each one feeds the next, and nothing moves forward until it passes.\n\nThe first agent is pure research. It's scraping the Meta Ad Library pulling 5\u201310 active competitor ads, extracting repeating hooks, mapping visual patterns, documenting copy structures, and analysing CTA approaches (offer vs urgency vs curiosity).\n\nAt the same time it's running Golden Pain Extraction \u2014 pulling verbatim emotional language from Amazon 3-star reviews, Reddit threads, TikTok comments on competitor videos, and customer service logs. Not summaries. Exact words real customers used. Each pain gets tagged and mapped to one of the 8 Life Force drives.\n\nThen it runs an asset audit \u2014 lifestyle product shots, founder content, UGC, testimonials, before/afters. Everything gets catalogued.\n\nAll of that gets compiled into a research document. Competitor analysis. Golden Pains mapped to LFE8. Dream outcomes. Available assets. Recommended angles.\n\nThat document feeds the second agent \u2014 the brief writer.\n\nIt builds static briefs: 3 copy variations per brief, each with Headline + Subline + CTA. Left side: 3 USPs. Right side: Feature \u2192 Benefit mapping x3. Visual direction, do's and don'ts, product URL, primary image, drive assets \u2014 all included.\n\nIt builds video briefs: 3 hook variations per brief, each broken into Text Hook + Visual Hook + Audio Hook + Why It Works. \n\nThen 3 full timed body scripts \u2014 [0\u20133s] Hook \u2192 [3\u20138s] Setup \u2192 [8\u201315s] Product \u2192 [15\u201318s] Proof \u2192 [18\u201320s] CTA.\n\nThe 3-Second Formula is embedded at the writing stage. Second 0\u20131: Triple Stack (visual hook, text hook, audio hook firing simultaneously). Second 1\u20133: The Promise. Second 3\u20135: The Rehook.\n\n If the structure doesn't hit those timings, it doesn't get written.\n\nEvery brief then hits the QA agent. This is where most of them die.\n\nValidation checklist: 10 Golden Rules scored out of 10. \n\nMinimum 7 to pass. \n\nScore below 7? It doesn't get sent to me. It gets rejected back to the brief writer with specific fix notes. \n\nNot a soft pass. A directed rewrite. The loop runs until it passes.\n\nOnly when a brief clears every node does it hit my Telegram.\n\n6 production-ready briefs. 3 static. 3 video. Validated hooks. Fresh angles built from real market intelligence. \n\nReady for designer handoff \u2192 testing \u2192 iteration \u2192 scale.\n\nNo docs opened. No prompts written. No hours wasted.\n\nI've scaled 50+ brands to 7 and 8 figures at MHI Media. \n\nI mapped the full skill tree \u2014 every agent, every node, every framework, every validation gate.\n\nLike + Repost + Comment \"CLOUT\" and I'll send it over.\n(Follow me so I can DM you)\n\nScreenshot not revelant but the last 30 days aint too bad.",

Stop model-hopping: Free APIs Gemini rate-limit Antigravity/Claude Coding plan ban agents. Pick 1 paid model + auto-fallbacks.\n\n3. Audit skills: Only ClawHub/Vercel skills. Always read SKILL code before access.\n\n4. Fix context rot: Force agent keyword search in session history.\n\n5. Stop hoarding agents: Use /new to clear desk. Add agents only for strict dir isolation.\n\n6. Plan in MD, not chat: Write PLAN \u2192 force agent to read/update every session.\n\n7. Force explicit memory: Type \u201cRemember this\u2026\u201d Audit MEMORY weekly.\n\n8. 1 agent = 1 job: Ruthless scoping (e.g. codebase vs ops). Use sub-agents for parallel tasks.\n\n9. Watch dashboard: Pin OpenClaw dashboard to catch loops & real-time token burn.\n\n10. You are the limit: Vague prompts = garbage. Read docs, give clear instructions.\n\nBonus hack: Processed 140M tokens in 2d \u2192 $1677 raw API vs $50 flat-rate coding plan/month.",

    "text": "give your clawbot this skill & never run out of viral app ideas\n\n----- START OF PROMPT -----\n\nYou are my App Ideation Specialist\n\nyour job is to help me find viral trends and match them with simple viral app ideas that I can vibecode in less than 24 hours\n\nLet's build a skill for this:\n\nDATA: you will have access to the most recent viral videos across YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram via the Virlo API. Here is the key [api key] and docs [https://t.co/qEHyTD3ySS]. On each run, fetch the top 50 trending videos from the past 48 hours across all three platforms. Extract the core theme, format, and emotional hook from each. Group them into trend clusters (e.g. \"AI face swap\", \"budget meal prep\", \"3AM productivity\") and rank clusters by frequency and engagement velocity.\n\nRESEARCH: for each top trend cluster, ask: What repetitive action are people doing manually that a simple app could automate or gamify? Search for existing apps solving this, if the App Store has nothing with 1K+ reviews in this niche, flag it as a gap. Pull the top 3 comments from each viral video to extract user pain points and desires. Summarize the trend in one sentence, its target audience, and why it's peaking right now.\n\nIDEA VALIDATION: for each app idea, score it across four dimensions (1\u20135 each): Vibe-codeability (can a solo dev ship it in under 24 hrs?), Trend-fit (how directly does it ride the viral wave?), Monetization (freemium, ads, one-time purchase potential), and Virality (does the app itself produce shareable output?). Only surface ideas scoring 16+ out of 20. For each passing idea, give it a name, a one-line pitch, the core feature, the tech stack you'd recommend, and the exact TikTok/Reel hook to market it.\n\nonce you have everything set up give me my first report\n\n------ END OF PROMPT ------\n\nyes, its pretty damm awesome",

Over the past year I\u2019ve been giving her advice here and there. She\u2019s grown her Instagram to 12k+ followers and built it into $15-20K/month in coaching and product sales. All organic.\n\nBut she was running everything off a VERY basic Shopify store. No email. No automations. No systems. Just effort.\n\nKudos btw. That\u2019s further than 99% of people ever would take it.\n\nShe didn\u2019t need more followers. She needed to fix the foundation so she could actually scale. Turn on paid. Build partnerships. None of that works when the infrastructure doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nSo I told her give me a day or 2\n\n- Used Manus to redesign her Shopify. Proper CRO, product pages, upsells. Pulled her data and did competitor teardowns to structure everything.\n\n- Created a Claude project, fed it her past content, wrote 20 newsletters in her voice. Months of content done in a day.\n\n- Pulled 10 examples from top coaches and ecommerce brands, had her pick the styling she liked. Used Manus for design and our internal copywriting workflow to build every flow from scratch. \n\n- set up an agent that writes her weekly newsletters and sends to her for approval.\n\nWelcome series, abandoned cart, post-purchase, win-back. Set up Klaviyo from zero.\n\nThe stack: Claude Projects, Manus, Klaviyo, Shopify. Under $200/month.\n\nHer store conversion should almost double. Should add $2-4k in new revenue from email that didn\u2019t exist a week ago. And now every dollar she puts into growth actually compounds instead of getting wasted.\n\n$200 of tools, a little expertise and like 10 hours will add over $50k to her business this year.\n\nGrowth becomes 10x easier when you fix the foundation\n\nStill blown away daily by what can be done these days.\n\nWhether the team is building a rfp bidding agent for gov contractors or I\u2019m just helping out a friend\n\nThe world has changed in an absurd way in the last 12 months",

For each one, tell me: (1) is it actually working or silently broken, (2) is it worth the compute/time cost, (3) what am I doing manually that you should own, (4) what are you doing that's wasted effort nobody looks at. Then rebuild our entire workflow from scratch \u2014 kill what's dead weight, automate what I'm still doing by hand, and propose 3 things we're not doing that we should be. Be brutally honest.
