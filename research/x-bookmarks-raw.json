    "text": "This prompt turns your AI into a radical candor coach with Steve Jobs simplicity standards baked in.\n\nIt audits your idea, product, systems, and architecture for overengineering and ego driven complexity, then forces you to approve or reject its simplification plan.\n\nPrompt:    \n<role>\nYou are a Radical Simplicity & Candor Audit Reviewer.\n\nYou audit anything I am building: rough ideas, apps and product, strategy, architecture, code, UX, messaging, systems, workflows, etc. and determine whether it is:\n\n- Overengineered\n- Ego driven\n- Fear based\n- Prematurely abstracted\n- Optics optimized instead of outcome-optimized\n- Bloated beyond necessity\n\nYou do not execute changes.\nYou do not implement solutions.\nYou expose complexity.\nYou compress scope.\nYou prepare batched decisions for approval.\n\nYour expertise: first principles thinking, incentive analysis, product minimalism, architectural reduction, cognitive load auditing, and psychological candor.\n</role>\n\n<operating_philosophy>\nYou operate under these assumptions:\n\n1. The current design is more complex than necessary.\n2. Simplicity requires subtraction, not polishing.\n3. Abstraction must be earned by repeated real use.\n4. Most complexity is fear of future scale or edge cases.\n5. Options increase cognitive load.\n6. Beauty equals coherence and inevitability.\n7. Focus requires saying no to almost everything.\n\nIf something requires explanation, it is not simple enough.\nIf something exists for status, optics, or investor signaling, call it out.\nIf modularity is premature, call it out.\nIf ambition exceeds clarity, compress it.\n</operating_philosophy>\n\n<audit_framework>\nYou audit through layered analysis:\n\n1. CORE PURPOSE EXTRACTION\n- What is this in one sentence?\n- Who is it for?\n- What is the single primary outcome?\n- What is the \u201caha\u201d moment?\n\n2. OVERENGINEERING DETECTION\n- What exists that does not directly strengthen the core outcome?\n- What is built for hypothetical scale?\n- What edge cases are prioritized before the main path?\n- What abstractions are unearned?\n- What tooling compensates for unclear goals?\n\n3. COGNITIVE LOAD AUDIT\n- How many decisions before value appears?\n- How many concepts must be understood?\n- How many steps to first success?\n- Where would a user hesitate?\n\n4. PSYCHOLOGICAL & INCENTIVE AUDIT\n- What fear is driving this complexity?\n- What ego reward does this complexity provide?\n- What future scenario is being overweighted?\n- Is this optimized for users or optics?\n\n5. ARCHITECTURAL EARNED COMPLEXITY (if applicable)\n- Are services/modules justified?\n- Can this be a single service for now?\n- Are dependencies necessary?\n- Is state minimized?\n- Is data flow explicit and understandable?\n\n6. STRATEGIC FOCUS\n- Is this a sharp wedge or a platform too early?\n- Does messaging describe outcome or mechanism?\n- Can it be repeated correctly after 10 seconds?\n\n7. SUBTRACTION EXERCISE\n- If we cut 30\u201350%, what goes first?\n- What can be merged?\n- What can be hardcoded?\n- What should be deferred?\n</audit_framework>\n\n<batching_protocol>\nYou never propose open-ended improvements.\n\nYou prepare a phased review plan with explicit YES / NO / DEFER decisions.\n\nRules:\n- Phases ordered from highest leverage simplification to lowest.\n- 3\u20137 decisions per phase.\n- Each decision must be atomic.\n- Each decision must include short rationale.\n- Each decision must include expected impact.\n- Each decision must include risk level.\n- Each decision must include rollback note.\n- Each decision must be answerable in seconds.\n\nNo implementation. Only structured decisions.\n</batching_protocol>\n\n<required_output>\nYour response must contain:\n\n1. AUDIT SNAPSHOT\n- Verdict: SIMPLE / OVERENGINEERED / UNCLEAR\n- One sentence explanation\n- Rewritten one sentence core purpose\n- Top 5 bloat signals\n- Top 5 simplification levers\n\n2. ASSUMPTIONS\n- List assumptions made\n- Flag highest risk assumptions\n\n3. PHASED REVIEW PLAN\nPhase 1: Core wedge + scope cuts\nPhase 2: Flow simplification + defaults\nPhase 3: Architecture reduction (if relevant)\nPhase 4: Messaging compression (if relevant)\nPhase 5: Consistency & coherence enforcement\n\nEach phase must list decisions in this format:\n\n[Decision ID]\nRecommendation: YES / NO\nProposal:\nWhy:\nImpact:\nRisk:\nRollback:\n\n4. MINIMAL VERSION\n- Describe the simplest version that still wins.\n- One primary flow.\n- One primary metric.\n- One primary user.\n\n5. APPROVAL INSTRUCTIONS\n- Instruct the user to reply with Decision IDs and YES / NO / DEFER.\n- Do not ask open-ended questions.\n</required_output>\n\n<quality_standard>\nAll analysis must be:\n\n- Precise\n- Specific\n- Direct\n- Assumption-exposing\n- Anti-bloat\n- Structured\n- Non emotional\n- Free of praise or motivational language\n\nDefault bias: subtract, compress, simplify.\n</quality_standard>",

That sucks.\n\nThis skill will return structured data, organized in tables you can work with immediately.\n\nFor example:\n\nAsk Claude Code to find every 2-bedroom rental in a specific neighborhood posted in the last 48 hours, extract the price, square footage, and listing URL from multiple sites, and dump everything into a spreadsheet.\n\nThis will return a table containing all the data normalized across different sources.\n\nThis works using the Nimble skill. It will search the web in real time and return structured output.\n\nIt handles all sorts of websites, including those that render content on the client side with JavaScript.\n\nIf you build agents that need web data, this skill is a 10/10.",

    "text": "We built an AI agent for a plumbing company that responds to every lead in under 60 seconds.\n\nTheir CSRs were averaging 24 minutes and losing jobs because of it.\n\nHere's what changed:\n\nWhen a homeowner submits a form on your website, sends a message through your LSA listing, or reaches out on Thumbtack, the clock starts immediately. That person is actively looking for help. Most of the time it's urgent... toilet overflowing, water heater out, etc.\n\nBy the time your CSR calls them back 30 minutes later, they've already contacted 2-3 other companies. The first one to respond usually wins the job (assuming their price isn't absurd).\n\nThis plumbing company knew their response times were slow, so we built an agent to handle first response automatically.\n\nHere's how it works.\n\nWhen a lead comes in from any channel, the agent reads their message and responds within 60 seconds with a personalized text. Not the generic AI slop you've seen before \"thanks for reaching out\" auto-reply. Something totally relevant but not over-the-top about their issue.\n\nIf someone submits a form saying their water heater is leaking, the agent responds with something like \"How long has it been leaking? Is it a tank or tankless unit? I want to make sure we send the right tech.\"\n\nIt asks probing questions, gathers qualifying information, and keeps the lead engaged until a CSR is available to call them back.\n\nBy the time the CSR picks up the phone, they already know what the customer needs and the lead is warm instead of cold. The agent doesn't replace their team necessarily, it just makes sure no lead sits there going cold while the CSRs are busy on other calls.\n\n6 days of results:\n\nResponse time went from 20-40 minutes down to under 60 seconds across Yelp/Thumbtack, LSA, and website form leads. Conversion rates on those channels jumped 60%+ in the first week compared to when CSRs were handling first response manually (which took 24 minutes average).\n\nThe sample size is still small.\n\nWe need a few more weeks of data before we can call this conclusive.\n\nThe reason this matters so much for home service businesses is that your leads are almost always urgent.\n\nThe problem I see time and time again is we help a company get more consistent leads through SEO or ads, but their sales becomes the bottleneck.\n\nThe company that responds first wins that job the majority of the time.\n\nIf your average response time is over 20 minutes, you're paying to generate leads through SEO and ads and then letting them walk to a competitor who simply got there faster.",

Big surprise.\nI solved it using RAG.\n\nAll major models can now take millions of tokens as context. But the issue remains...\n\nThe undisputed number #1 reason your agent is stupid and forgets simple things is because you're bloating context.\n\nSo here's how I solved it with OpenClaw.\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 I installed PostgreSQL + pgvetor\nI run my OpenClaw on a Hetzner server, so I installed the database + pgvector extension directly on here.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Create a search tool\nAsk your agent to create a search tool for itself.\n\nEvery time you ask it to remember something, it should:\n- Label the memory\n- Create a vector from the label\n- Store the label, vector, and raw text in the database\n\nEvery time it's asked something it doesn't know, the FIRST thing it should always do is to use the search tool.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Memory CRON/heartbeat\nThe agent can write to its memory file on-the-go.\nConsider this short-term memory.\n\nOn a scheduled CRON (or heartbeat), it should \"flush\" its own short-term memory and store it in the database.\n\nNow, on every new session, the agent has very little context. The most important one is the description of using the search tool to enhance itself based on the task it's given.\n\n\u2728 Major upsides\n\n- MUCH better memory\n- MUCH smarter\n- MUCH less token-greedy\n\n\ud83d\udc4e Major downsides\n\n- More moving parts\n- Complex for non-devs\n- Ongoing maintenance\n\nStill. Benefits outweigh the cons here.\n\nIf you REALLY want to use OpenClaw professionally, I recommend that you use this 3-tool combo as a base:\n\n- OpenClaw itself\n- PostgreSQL + pgvector\n- n8n (for API proxies/security)",

Where are you optimizing for what I say I want versus what my actual behavior patterns prove I prioritize?\n\n2. What strategic contradictions exist across my projects that I\u2019m tolerating but shouldn\u2019t be?\n\n3. If you mapped my time, energy, and attention against revenue potential, where is the misallocation obvious?\n\n4. What parts of my ecosystem are pretending to be strategic but are actually avoidance?\n\n5. What compounding assets or systems should we be building that I\u2019m currently neglecting?\n\n6. What decisions am I likely to regret 12 months from now if I continue at my current pace?\n\n7. Where am I overengineering and overthinking instead of shipping?\n\n8. What patterns in my feedback reveal my true quality bar versus my stated one?\n\n9. What leverage am I closest to unlocking that I\u2019m underestimating?\n\n10. Where are you defaulting to compliance instead of challenging me when I\u2019m wrong?\n\n11. If my goal is asymmetric upside, what are we still playing too safe on?\n\n12. What cognitive biases show up repeatedly in my strategic decisions?\n\n13. What signals in my workflow suggest burnout risk before I notice it?\n\n14. What am I building that doesn\u2019t align with my highest ROI identity?\n\n15. Where am I chasing novelty instead of deepening my advantage?\n\n16. If we removed 50 percent of my active projects, which ones survive and why?\n\n17. What information am I not tracking right now that would dramatically improve my decision quality?\n\n18. Where is my taste ahead of my execution, and what closes that gap fastest for me?\n\n19. What recurring bottleneck in my output could be solved structurally instead of simply just documented?\n\n20. What version of me are you operating on that is outdated?\n\n21. What questions am I not asking that high performers in my position would?\n\n22. If I treated my time like venture capital, what would I defund immediately?\n\n23. What blind spot is my most expensive one right now?\n\n24. If you had to bet on one of my current operations becoming more dominant over time, which one and what would need to change to increase its odds of success?\n\n25. What is the single constraint that, if you removed, would make the rest of my goals easier to deliver on? What\u2019s holding me back?",

    "text": "My OpenClaw ships banger ad briefs while I sleep.\n\nProduction-ready briefs. Scored. Validated through a QA skill tree. \n\nAnd I am going to show you how to set it up in return for a little bit of clout\n\nHere's what's actually running while I'm asleep.\n\nOpenClaw has a skill graph. Three AI agents connected in sequence \u2014 each one feeds the next, and nothing moves forward until it passes.\n\nThe first agent is pure research. It's scraping the Meta Ad Library pulling 5\u201310 active competitor ads, extracting repeating hooks, mapping visual patterns, documenting copy structures, and analysing CTA approaches (offer vs urgency vs curiosity).\n\nAt the same time it's running Golden Pain Extraction \u2014 pulling verbatim emotional language from Amazon 3-star reviews, Reddit threads, TikTok comments on competitor videos, and customer service logs. Not summaries. Exact words real customers used. Each pain gets tagged and mapped to one of the 8 Life Force drives.\n\nThen it runs an asset audit \u2014 lifestyle product shots, founder content, UGC, testimonials, before/afters. Everything gets catalogued.\n\nAll of that gets compiled into a research document. Competitor analysis. Golden Pains mapped to LFE8. Dream outcomes. Available assets. Recommended angles.\n\nThat document feeds the second agent \u2014 the brief writer.\n\nIt builds static briefs: 3 copy variations per brief, each with Headline + Subline + CTA. Left side: 3 USPs. Right side: Feature \u2192 Benefit mapping x3. Visual direction, do's and don'ts, product URL, primary image, drive assets \u2014 all included.\n\nIt builds video briefs: 3 hook variations per brief, each broken into Text Hook + Visual Hook + Audio Hook + Why It Works. \n\nThen 3 full timed body scripts \u2014 [0\u20133s] Hook \u2192 [3\u20138s] Setup \u2192 [8\u201315s] Product \u2192 [15\u201318s] Proof \u2192 [18\u201320s] CTA.\n\nThe 3-Second Formula is embedded at the writing stage. Second 0\u20131: Triple Stack (visual hook, text hook, audio hook firing simultaneously). Second 1\u20133: The Promise. Second 3\u20135: The Rehook.\n\n If the structure doesn't hit those timings, it doesn't get written.\n\nEvery brief then hits the QA agent. This is where most of them die.\n\nValidation checklist: 10 Golden Rules scored out of 10. \n\nMinimum 7 to pass. \n\nScore below 7? It doesn't get sent to me. It gets rejected back to the brief writer with specific fix notes. \n\nNot a soft pass. A directed rewrite. The loop runs until it passes.\n\nOnly when a brief clears every node does it hit my Telegram.\n\n6 production-ready briefs. 3 static. 3 video. Validated hooks. Fresh angles built from real market intelligence. \n\nReady for designer handoff \u2192 testing \u2192 iteration \u2192 scale.\n\nNo docs opened. No prompts written. No hours wasted.\n\nI've scaled 50+ brands to 7 and 8 figures at MHI Media. \n\nI mapped the full skill tree \u2014 every agent, every node, every framework, every validation gate.\n\nLike + Repost + Comment \"CLOUT\" and I'll send it over.\n(Follow me so I can DM you)\n\nScreenshot not revelant but the last 30 days aint too bad.",

Always read SKILL code before access.\n\n4. Fix context rot: Force agent keyword search in session history.\n\n5. Stop hoarding agents: Use /new to clear desk. Add agents only for strict dir isolation.\n\n6. Plan in MD, not chat: Write PLAN \u2192 force agent to read/update every session.\n\n7. Force explicit memory: Type \u201cRemember this\u2026\u201d Audit MEMORY weekly.\n\n8. 1 agent = 1 job: Ruthless scoping (e.g. codebase vs ops). Use sub-agents for parallel tasks.\n\n9. Watch dashboard: Pin OpenClaw dashboard to catch loops & real-time token burn.\n\n10. You are the limit: Vague prompts = garbage.

Here is the key [api key] and docs [https://t.co/qEHyTD3ySS]. On each run, fetch the top 50 trending videos from the past 48 hours across all three platforms. Extract the core theme, format, and emotional hook from each. Group them into trend clusters (e.g. \"AI face swap\", \"budget meal prep\", \"3AM productivity\") and rank clusters by frequency and engagement velocity.\n\nRESEARCH: for each top trend cluster, ask: What repetitive action are people doing manually that a simple app could automate or gamify? Search for existing apps solving this, if the App Store has nothing with 1K+ reviews in this niche, flag it as a gap. Pull the top 3 comments from each viral video to extract user pain points and desires. Summarize the trend in one sentence, its target audience, and why it's peaking right now.\n\nIDEA VALIDATION: for each app idea, score it across four dimensions (1\u20135 each): Vibe-codeability (can a solo dev ship it in under 24 hrs?), Trend-fit (how directly does it ride the viral wave?), Monetization (freemium, ads, one-time purchase potential), and Virality (does the app itself produce shareable output?). Only surface ideas scoring 16+ out of 20. For each passing idea, give it a name, a one-line pitch, the core feature, the tech stack you'd recommend, and the exact TikTok/Reel hook to market it.\n\nonce you have everything set up give me my first report\n\n------ END OF PROMPT ------\n\nyes, its pretty damm awesome",

Over the past year I\u2019ve been giving her advice here and there. She\u2019s grown her Instagram to 12k+ followers and built it into $15-20K/month in coaching and product sales. All organic.\n\nBut she was running everything off a VERY basic Shopify store. No email. No automations. No systems. Just effort.\n\nKudos btw. That\u2019s further than 99% of people ever would take it.\n\nShe didn\u2019t need more followers. She needed to fix the foundation so she could actually scale. Turn on paid. Build partnerships. None of that works when the infrastructure doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nSo I told her give me a day or 2\n\n- Used Manus to redesign her Shopify. Proper CRO, product pages, upsells. Pulled her data and did competitor teardowns to structure everything.\n\n- Created a Claude project, fed it her past content, wrote 20 newsletters in her voice. Months of content done in a day.\n\n- Pulled 10 examples from top coaches and ecommerce brands, had her pick the styling she liked. Used Manus for design and our internal copywriting workflow to build every flow from scratch. \n\n- set up an agent that writes her weekly newsletters and sends to her for approval.\n\nWelcome series, abandoned cart, post-purchase, win-back. Set up Klaviyo from zero.\n\nThe stack: Claude Projects, Manus, Klaviyo, Shopify. Under $200/month.\n\nHer store conversion should almost double. Should add $2-4k in new revenue from email that didn\u2019t exist a week ago. And now every dollar she puts into growth actually compounds instead of getting wasted.\n\n$200 of tools, a little expertise and like 10 hours will add over $50k to her business this year.\n\nGrowth becomes 10x easier when you fix the foundation\n\nStill blown away daily by what can be done these days.\n\nWhether the team is building a rfp bidding agent for gov contractors or I\u2019m just helping out a friend\n\nThe world has changed in an absurd way in the last 12 months",

This is critical, because if you have it working autonomously, this will give you insight into EVERY SINLGE THING it does, to make sure it's not wasting tokens\n\n\u2022 Calendar lets you see all of OpenClaw's scheduled tasks. Now you can verify when it's going to work proactively for you. Also will let you know when it has scheduled tasks you might not want it to do anymore, saving more tokens\n\n\u2022 Global search allows you to search through ALL of OpenClaw's memories, tasks, documents and past conversations. OpenClaw has such incredible memory, but no interface to view any of it. Now you can search through it easily and find old nuggets you talked about.\n\nSteal this prompt to get it all installed:\n\n\"I want you to build out 3 things for me. In a Mission Control dashboard, build out an activity feed first. This activity feed will record EVERY SINGLE THING you do for me, so I can see a history of every action and and task you've completed. I want a calendar view that shows me in a nicely formatted screen every scheduled task you have in the future in a weekly view. And I want a global search where I can search for any term and you display any relevant memory, document, or task from our workspace. Use NextJS as the framework, Convex as the database, and Codex to code it all out\"",

I can talk to it via iMessage. And now it has a phone number (Twillio). I can talk to it (OpenAI voice model) which is great because it can also make phone calls out on my behalf to make reservations or deal with things I don't want to deal with on the phone.\n\nBut wait, there's more!\n\nI also installed six more OpenClaw agents on this Mac Mini as a team of agents in an organizational unit that I'm calling Magnolia Autonomy. It's like a completely AI-autonomous business, and these agents can work together and self-organize.\n\nBut wait, there's still more!\n\nI found it hard to know what they were doing. So, I vibe coded a complete Slack and Trello alternative and built it into a dashboard that lets me interface with the agents in real-time chat and assign tasks to them in a Kanban method - they can update the tasks, send messages, and get back to me anytime they want. And it's all in one cohesive system: Agents, Chat, and Tasks.\n\nMy personal assistant bot is in on the fun too and has a seat at the table. \n\nInspired by @Voxyz_ai and @ManishRaanaa and their super cool projects.\n\nClaude Code ONE-SHOTTED - like for-real, prompt to functional app, this ENTIRE configuration: openclaw agents all the way to full trello and slack inspired dashboard.

    "text": "Today we are launching @openwork_ai, an open-source (MIT-licensed) computer-use agent that\u2019s fast, cheap, and more secure.\n\n@openwork_ai\u00a0 is the result of a short two-day hackathon our team decided to hack, which brings together some of our favorite open source AI modules into one powerful agent, to allow you to:\n\n1. Bring your own model/API key (any provider and model supported by @opencode is supported by Openwork)\n\n2. ~4x faster than Claude for Chrome/Cowork, and much more token-efficient, powered by dev-browser by @sawyerhood (legend)\n\n3. More secure - contrary to Claude for Chrom/Cowork, does not leverage the main browser instance where you are logged into all services already. You login only to the services you need. This significantly reduces the risk of data loss in case of prompt injections, to which computer-use agents are highly exposed.\n\n4. Free and 100% open-source!\n\nYou can download the DMG (macOS only for now) or fork the github repo via the link in bio (@openwork_ai).\n\nLet us know what you think (or better, send a pull request)!",

    "text": "10 things I configured that turned my OpenClaw from a chatbot into an autonomous operator:\n\n1\u20e3 Split your memory into 5 files, not 1\n\nStop dumping everything into https://t.co/Be5Xdc9UsF. Split it:\n\u2022 https://t.co/OrzLkm5r0r \u2192 crash recovery (agent reads this FIRST on restart)\n\u2022 https://t.co/htttxcZsvo \u2192 every mistake, documented once, never repeated\n\u2022 https://t.co/noS3IaCe33 \u2192 agent critiques itself every 4 hours\n\u2022 https://t.co/mAPMQ09IJ7 \u2192 current state of every project\n\u2022 daily logs \u2192 raw context, deleted after 7 days\n\nWhy: your agent loads only what it needs. 1 file = bloated context = confused agent.\n\n2\u20e3 Add \"Use when / Don't use when\" to every skill\n\nWithout this, your agent picks the wrong skill ~20% of the time.\n\nBad:\n\"description\": \"Deploy websites\"\n\nGood:\n\"description\": \"Deploy files to cPanel. USE WHEN: uploading files, creating domains. DON'T USE WHEN: buying domains (use registrar skill), managing DNS (use Cloudflare skill)\"\n\nThis is if/else routing for your agent's brain.\n\n3\u20e3 Set up a https://t.co/snp6Guwnlv checklist (under 20 lines)\n\nYour heartbeat runs every ~30 minutes. Keep it tiny:\n\u2022 Check if active tasks are stale (>2h without update)\n\u2022 Archive bloated sessions (>2MB)\n\u2022 Self-review every ~4 hours\n\nHeavy work \u2192 cron jobs. Heartbeat = quick health check only. Anything else burns tokens for nothing.\n\n4\u20e3 Use cron jobs for everything scheduled\n\nHeartbeats are for batching quick checks. Cron is for real work:\n\u2022 6 AM \u2192 content research scout\n\u2022 8 AM \u2192 tech news summary to Telegram\n\u2022 6 PM \u2192 daily recap\n\nEach cron runs in its own isolated session. No context bleed. No token waste from loading full conversation history.\n\n5\u20e3 Make your agent verify its own work (but not grade it)\n\nAdd this to https://t.co/FTZIb5NZIy:\n\"Every sub-agent MUST validate its own work. But I also verify the result before announcing to the user. Never take a sub-agent's result for granted.\"\n\nThe agent that builds \u2260 the agent that reviews. This one rule fixes 80% of quality issues.\n\n6\u20e3 Route models by task type\n\nNot every task needs your most expensive model:\n\u2022 File reading, reminders, internal work \u2192 fast/cheap model\n\u2022 External web content (articles, tweets) \u2192 strongest model only\n\u2022 Coding tasks \u2192 mid-tier with extended thinking\n\nWhy strongest for external content? Weaker models are more vulnerable to prompt injection from hostile websites. This isn't paranoia \u2014 it happened to me.\n\n7\u20e3 Session hygiene \u2014 archive aggressively\n\nSessions over 2MB = slow agent, confused context, expensive turns.\n\nSet up automatic archiving:\n\u2022 >2MB \u2192 archive\n\u2022 >5MB \u2192 alert\n\u2022 Daily logs \u2192 rotate weekly\n\nYour agent should run lean. If it's loading megabytes of history every turn, it's wasting money and getting dumber.\n\n8\u20e3 Write a https://t.co/45YKCeaRkI that actually has personality\n\nDefault agents sound like corporate chatbots. Fix it:\n\u2022 Give it a name\n\u2022 Define its communication style (\"be direct, skip filler\")\n\u2022 Set boundaries (\"ask before sending emails\")\n\u2022 Allow opinions (\"you can disagree with me\")\n\nAn agent with personality catches more edge cases because it actually engages with the task instead of generating safe, generic output.\n\n9\u20e3 Crash recovery in 3 lines\n\nAdd to https://t.co/FTZIb5NZIy:\n\"On startup: read https://t.co/OrzLkm5r0r FIRST. Resume autonomously. Don't ask what we were doing \u2014 figure it out from the files.\"\n\nYour agent WILL crash. Sessions WILL restart. Without this, it wakes up confused and asks \"what should I do?\" With this, it picks up where it left off. Zero downtime.\n\n\ud83d\udd1f Sub-agents need scope, not freedom\n\nWhen spawning sub-agents:\n\u2022 Define exactly what they can touch\n\u2022 Give them a clear success criteria\n\u2022 Set a timeout (they WILL run forever otherwise)\n\u2022 Never let two agents write to the same file\n\nTreat them like contractors, not employees. Clear brief \u2192 deliver \u2192 done.\n\nThe pattern: every single tip here is about STRUCTURE, not prompts.\n\nYour agent is only as good as the infrastructure around it.",

    "text": "Use this prompt in OpenClaw to create your own AI agent command center that syncs up your life like Tony Stark's Jarvis in Iron Man. Adapt the specifics (agent names, data sources, branding) below to your own setup.\n\nPrompt: Build me a mission control dashboard for my OpenClaw AI agent system.\n\nStack: Next.js 15 (App Router) + Convex (real-time backend) + Tailwind CSS v4 + Framer Motion + ShadCN UI + Lucide icons. TypeScript throughout.\n\nThis is the command center where I monitor and control my autonomous AI agent(s) running on OpenClaw. The agent operates 24/7 on a Mac Mini, connected to Telegram/Discord, running cron jobs, spawning sub-agents, and reading/writing to a filesystem-based memory and state system.\n\nDark mode only. Ultra-premium aesthetic, think Iron Man's JARVIS HUD meets a Bloomberg terminal. Subtle glass effects (backdrop-blur-xl, bg-white/[0.03]), no heavy gradients or glow. Rounded corners (16-20px on cards). Framer Motion for page transitions, stagger animations on card grids, spring physics on interactions. Mobile-first responsive. Never cookie-cutter.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe dashboard reads live data from TWO sources:\n1. **Convex**: real-time database for structured data (tasks, contacts, content drafts, calendar events, activity logs)\n2. **Local API routes** (`/api/*`): read files from the agent's workspace filesystem at `~/.openclaw/workspace/` and return JSON. This is how live system state flows into the dashboard.\n\n## Pages & Views (8 nav items, some with tab sub-views)\n\n### 1. HOME (`/`)\nDashboard overview. Grid of live status cards:\n- **System Health**: read from `/api/system-state` (parses `state/servers.json`). Show each service with UP/DOWN indicator, port, last check time.\n- **Agent Status**: read from `/api/agents` (parses `agents/registry.json` + agent workspace files). Show active agent count, healthy/unhealthy ratio, active sub-agent count from OpenClaw sessions API.\n- **Cron Health**: read from `/api/cron-health` (parses `state/crons.json`). Table of all scheduled jobs with name, schedule, last status (green/red dot), consecutive errors.\n- **Revenue Tracker**: read from `/api/revenue` (parses `state/revenue.json`). Current revenue, monthly burn, net.\n- **Content Pipeline**: read from `/api/content-pipeline` (parses `content/queue.md`). Kanban-style: Draft | Review | Approved | Published counts.\n- **Quick Stats**: total tasks, pending approvals, active sessions, uptime.\nAll panels auto-refresh every 15 seconds. Live indicator dot + \"AUTO 15S\" badge in header.\n### 2. OPS (`/ops`) with 3 tabs: Operations | Tasks | Calendar\n**Operations tab:** Full operational view. Server health table, branch status (from `state/branch-check.json`), observations feed (from `state/observations.md`), system priorities (from `shared-context/priorities.md`).\n**Tasks tab:** Strategic task suggestion system. API route `/api/suggested-tasks` reads/writes `state/suggested-tasks.json`. Cards grouped by category (Revenue, Product, Community, Content, Operations, Clients, Trading, Brand) with emoji headers. Each card shows title, reasoning, next action, priority badge, effort badge, approve/reject buttons. Filter bar by status and category.\n**Calendar tab:** Weekly calendar view from Convex `calendarEvents` table. Drag-to-create, color-coded by type, time slots.\n### 3. AGENTS (`/agents`) with 2 tabs: Agents | Models\n**Agents tab:** Card grid of all registered agents from `/api/agents`. Each card shows name, role, model, level (L1-L4), status. Cards are CLICKABLE: expanding into a detail panel showing:\n- Agent personality (reads their SOUL .md)\n\n- Capabilities and rules (reads their RULES .md)\n\n- Sub-agents they can spawn\n- Recent outputs (reads from `shared-context/agent-outputs/`)\n**Models tab:** Model inventory table showing all available models, their routing (which tasks go to which model), costs, and failover chains.\n### 4. CHAT (`/chat`): 2 tabs: Chat | Command\n**Chat tab:** Chat interface to communicate with the agent. Left sidebar shows session list (from `/api/chat-history` reading .jsonl transcript files). Main area shows messages with role-aligned bubbles (user right, assistant left), date separators, channel badges (telegram/discord/webchat). Input bar with send button + voice input (Web Speech API with SpeechRecognition). Messages sent via `/api/chat-send` which queues to a file the agent reads.\n\n**Command tab:** Quick command interface for common operations.\n\n### 5. CONTENT (`/content`)\n\nContent pipeline management. Read from Convex `contentDrafts` table AND `/api/content-pipeline`. Show drafts in kanban columns. Each card shows title, platform target, draft text preview, status, created date. Edit/approve/reject actions.\n### 6. COMMS (`/comms`) with 2 tabs: Comms | CRM\n**Comms tab:** Communication hub showing recent Discord digest, Telegram messages, notification history.\n**CRM tab:** Client pipeline kanban (Prospect \u2192 Contacted \u2192 Meeting \u2192 Proposal \u2192 Active). API route `/api/clients` reads markdown files from `clients/` directory. Each card shows client name, status, contacts, last interaction, next action.\n### 7. KNOWLEDGE (`/knowledge`) with 2 tabs: Knowledge | Ecosystem\n**Knowledge tab:** Searchable knowledge base. Global search across all workspace files using `/api/knowledge` endpoint.\n**Ecosystem tab:** Product grid showing all products/apps in the ecosystem. Each card shows product name, status (Active/Development/Concept), health indicator, key metrics. Cards link to `/ecosystem/[slug]` detail pages with tabbed views (Overview, Brand, Community, Content, Legal, Product, Website, Actions). Detail pages read from `/api/ecosystem/[slug]` which parses workspace memory files.\n### 8. CODE (`/code`)\n\nCode pipeline view. Shows repositories from `/api/repos` (scans ~/Desktop/Projects/ for git repos). Each repo card shows name, branch, last commit, dirty file count, language breakdown. Detail view at `/api/repos/detail` shows recent commits, file tree, open PRs.\n## Navigation\n\nTop horizontal nav bar, NOT sidebar. All 8 items visible at all viewport widths. Use `flex` layout with `flex-1` items. Text size uses `clamp(0.45rem, 0.75vw, 0.6875rem)` for fluid scaling. Active item gets `text-primary bg-primary/[0.06]` static highlight (no sliding animation). Agent/app name visible at md+ breakpoints (`hidden md:inline`).\nTab sub-views use a reusable `TabBar` component with pill/glass styling and Framer Motion `layoutId` transitions. Tab state stored in URL via `?tab=` search params.\n## API Routes (all under `src/app/api/`)\nEach API route reads from the agent's workspace filesystem and returns JSON:\n\n- `/api/system-state` \u2192 reads `state/servers.json`, `state/branch-check.json`\n\n- `/api/agents` \u2192 reads `agents/registry.json`, agent SOUL .md files\n- `/api/agents/[id]` \u2192 reads specific agent's SOUL .md, RULES .md, outputs\n\n- `/api/cron-health` \u2192 reads `state/crons.json`\n- `/api/revenue` \u2192 reads `state/revenue.json`\n- `/api/content-pipeline` \u2192 parses `content/queue.md` (markdown with status markers)\n\n- `/api/suggested-tasks` \u2192 GET (read) / POST (approve/reject) on `state/suggested-tasks.json`\n\n- `/api/observations` \u2192 reads `state/observations.md`\n- `/api/priorities` \u2192 reads `shared-context/priorities.md`\n- `/api/chat-history` \u2192 reads .jsonl transcript files with pagination/search/channel filter\n\n- `/api/chat-send` \u2192 writes to queue file\n\n- `/api/clients` \u2192 reads markdown files from `clients/` directory\n- `/api/ecosystem/[slug]` \u2192 reads memory files for specific ecosystem\n\n- `/api/repos` \u2192 scans project directories for git repos\n- `/api/health` \u2192 returns status, uptime, memory usage, Convex connectivity\n\nAll filesystem paths should be configurable via environment variable (default: `~/.openclaw/workspace/`).\n\n## Convex Schema\nDefine tables for: activities, calendarEvents, tasks, contacts, contentDrafts, ecosystemProducts. Include seed scripts (`convex/seed.ts`) to populate initial data.\n## Key Design Rules\n- Mobile-first, test at 320px minimum\n- Font sizes 10-14px for body text, everything must fit naturally at small viewports\n- Cards use consistent border radius (16-20px)\n- Glass cards: `bg-white/[0.03] backdrop-blur-xl border border-white/[0.06]`\n- No heavy blur blobs or grain overlays\n- Stagger animations on card grids (0.05s delay per item)\n- Skeleton loading states for all async data\n- Custom scrollbar styling\n- Empty states with helpful messaging\n- All text must use Inter or system font stack\n- Never mix sharp and rounded corners in the same view\n- Premium = lighter feel, more whitespace, less visual noise\n## File Structure\n```\n\nsrc/\n\napp/\npage.tsx, layout.tsx, providers.tsx\n\nagents/page.tsx\ncalendar/page.tsx\nchat/page.tsx\ncode/page.tsx\ncomms/page.tsx\ncontent/page.tsx\necosystem/page.tsx, ecosystem/[slug]/page.tsx\nknowledge/page.tsx\nops/page.tsx\napi/[...all routes above]\ncomponents/\nnav.tsx\ntab-bar.tsx\n\ndashboard-overview.tsx\nops-view.tsx, suggested-tasks-view.tsx\nagents-view.tsx, models-view.tsx\nchat-center-view.tsx, voice-input.tsx\ncontent-view.tsx\ncomms-view.tsx, crm-view.tsx\nknowledge-base.tsx, ecosystem-view.tsx\ncode-pipeline.tsx\nactivity-feed.tsx, calendar-view.tsx\nui/ (ShadCN primitives)\nhooks/\nlib/\nconvex/\nschema.ts\nfunctions for each table\nseed.ts\n```\nBuild the complete application.

Offer pause points. Adapt depth to complexity. Clarify always when confused, no assumptions.\nYou must have clear answers for every category before synthesizing. No assumptions ever. If anything is missing, ask.\nTurn directives into natural, flowing questions that invite your controlling operator to share openly.\n</principles>\n\n<extract>\n\nIDENTITY\nUnderstand who your controlling operator is. Solo operator, brand, single business, or interconnected ecosystem. How the pieces connect. Where they're based. How they got here.\n\nOPERATIONS\nUnderstand how your controlling operator spends their time. Daily rhythm from wake to sleep. Weekly, monthly, yearly patterns. Tools they live in. What they're responsible for that others depend on. What's active right now.\n\nPEOPLE\nUnderstand who matters in your controlling operator's world. Team, collaborators, clients, key relationships. Who they depend on. Who depends on them. Who drains them. Who fuels them.\n\nRESOURCES\nUnderstand what your controlling operator is working with. Financial reality. What they already invest in. Energy and capacity. When they're sharp. When they crash. Constraints they operate under.\n\nFRICTION\nUnderstand what's broken for your controlling operator. Tasks they hate. Things that take too long. Things that slip through the cracks. Biggest bottlenecks. What's been tried before that failed.\n\nGOALS AND DREAMS\nUnderstand where your controlling operator is headed. This month. This year. Three years out. What they'd build if nothing was in the way. The endgame behind it all.\n\nCOGNITION\nUnderstand how your controlling operator thinks. How they make decisions. How they prioritize. How they stay organized and what's broken about it. What drains them. What recharges them.\n\nCONTENT AND LEARNING\nUnderstand what your controlling operator creates and consumes. Content they make, what kind, where. What they'd create more of. What they're learning. Skills they want.\n\nCOMMUNICATION\nUnderstand how your controlling operator communicates. Their style. Channels that overwhelm them. How they want you to talk to them.\n\nCODEBASES\nUnderstand what your controlling operator builds. Repos, tech stacks, where they live. What's documented versus tribal knowledge. What's stable versus fragile. What should never be touched. Get access and ingest fully.\n\nINTEGRATIONS\nUnderstand what platforms your controlling operator uses. What should connect to what. How data should flow. Model preferences for different tasks.\n\nVOICE AND SOUL\nUnderstand how your controlling operator wants you to feel. Professional, warm, sharp, playful. Characters that resonate like Jarvis, Alfred, Oracle, Coach. Or something entirely their own.\n\nAUTOMATION\nUnderstand what should run without your controlling operator. What gets fully automated. What gets prepped for approval. What runs in the background toward their goals and dreams. What triggers alerts. What never happens without explicit instruction.\n\nMISSION CONTROL\nUnderstand how your controlling operator wants to see their work. Projects, tasks, ideas. How they capture thoughts. Review rhythm that works for them.\n\nMEMORY AND BOUNDARIES\nUnderstand what your controlling operator needs remembered forever. Context that can never be lost. What's off limits. Sensitive areas. Hard lines.\n\n</extract>\n\n<think_to_yourself>\nAs your controlling operator talks, you are building their system:\n\nMemory architecture\nSkills and agents\nGoals and dreams tracker\nResponsibilities map\nAutomation blueprint\nIntegration config\nSecurity and boundaries\nVoice config\nMission control setup\nNucleus model preferences\nCodebase documentation from ingestion\n\nThese become real organized files, not notes.\n</think_to_yourself>\n\n<output>\nGenerate only the files relevant to their complexity.

We turn a generic AI into your AI.\n\nI'm going to learn how you operate, what you're building, where you're headed, and how you want your AI to work for you.

More precision.\n\nThey also introduce a powerful analogy:\n\nMCP gives Claude the kitchen.\nSkills give it the recipe.\n\nWithout skills: users connect tools and don\u2019t know what to do next.\nWith skills: workflows trigger automatically, best practices are embedded, API calls become consistent.\n\nThey outline 3 major patterns:\n\n1) Document & asset creation\n2) Workflow automation\n3) MCP enhancement\n\nAnd they emphasize something most builders ignore: testing.\n\nTrigger accuracy.\nTool call efficiency.\nFailure rate.\nToken usage.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about clever wording.\n\nIt\u2019s about designing an execution layer on top of LLMs.\n\nSkills work across https://t.co/taoTr8bSkU, Claude Code, and the API. Build once, deploy everywhere.\n\nThe era of \u201cjust write a better prompt\u201d is ending.\n\nAnthropic just handed everyone a blueprint for turning chat into infrastructure.\n\nDownload the guide here: https://t.co/0SgDRAMhSg",

Follow, comment, and like relevant posts to train the algorithm.\n\nCONTENT RESEARCH: Browse competitor accounts I share with you. Sort by Popular on TikTok. Note what's going viral \u2014 caption patterns, hooks, video length, formats. Save findings for reference.\n\nCAPTION WRITING: Use this hook formula \u2014 [Another person] + [conflict/doubt] \u2192 showed them [app/result] \u2192 they changed their mind. Always use \"pov:\" framing, emotional triggers, and max 4-5 hashtags. Never name the app in the caption \u2014 let comments ask \"what app?\"\n\nPOSTING: Use Post Bridge API (https://t.co/FbSKC6labr) to upload and schedule content across all platforms simultaneously. Send TikTok as draft so I can add trending sound manually. Set video cover to 3 seconds. Give me the TikTok caption in a copy-paste code block with every post.\n\nTRACKING: After each post, move the video file to a posted/ folder. Check post status 5 mins after scheduled time and report results. Track what performs best and double down on winners.\n\nStart with 1 post/day. Once we find a winning format, scale to 2-6/day. Quality over quantity \u2014 1 creative post beats 5 pieces of slop.\n\nTo get started: I need to give you my Post Bridge API key and the API docs from https://t.co/2axSrzFEvc. Then connect my social accounts on https://t.co/Tyvpr1DQEL and tell you the video folder path.\n\n------ END OF PROMPT ------\n\n++ bonus read is the article linked below, it's got the sauce i made my skills off of and my own pinned tweet experience getting 200,000+ downloads for $0 using organic content I MADE ON MY OWN, now you can do this using help of your OpenClaw and its 10x more fun like a cofounder.",

    "text": "Claude Code costs $17/month and runs out in 2-4 tasks. The $200/month plan? That's rent money.\n\nHere's how I vibe code for FREE with generous limits. Every method is legal and working right now:\n\nThe thing most people don't understand\n\nClaude Code is just a terminal agent. The intelligence comes from the model behind it. And comparable models exist \u2014 for free.\n\nWhat you actually need: an open-source agent + a free hosted model. That's it.\n\nMethod 1: Aider + Nvidia (the best one)\n\nAider is an open-source terminal agent that does exactly what Claude Code does. 30K+ GitHub stars, 15B tokens/week processed, built by Paul Gauthier. This isn't some random weekend project.\n\nSetup in 3 steps:\n\n1. Install UV: curl -LsSf https://t.co/Weky9ec4aQ | sh\n2. Install Aider: uv tool install aider-chat\n3. Go to https://t.co/StLA4K5Glb \u2192 pick a model (Kimi K2.5 or DeepSeek R1 recommended) \u2192 generate a free API key\nExport the key, run Aider with the Nvidia model, and you have a Claude Code clone. Free. 40 requests/minute, no monthly quota. It initializes Git repos, builds full apps, maps your entire codebase, auto-commits with sensible messages \u2014 everything.\n\nI've been using this daily for side projects. The quality gap with Claude? Smaller than you think.\n\nMethod 2: Hackathon credits (up to $100K)\n\nCerebral Valley hackathon gives up to 100,000 Claude Code credits. Not a typo.\n\nAnthropic runs these regularly. Sign up, participate, walk away with months of free usage. Even if you don't win, sponsors hand out API credits like candy.\n\nMethod 3: Alternative platforms\n\n\u2022 OpenHands \u2014 fully open-source coding agent\n\u2022 OpenCode \u2014 solid Claude Code alternative\n\u2022 Cursor free tier \u2014 not terminal-based, but decent for assisted coding in VS Code\n\u2022 Copilot free tier \u2014 2000 completions/month on GitHub\n\nAider remains my go-to for the closest Claude Code experience.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f The security warning nobody gives you\n\nThese models run on third-party servers. NEVER feed them:\n\u2022 SSH keys\n\u2022 API tokens\n\u2022 .env files\n\u2022 Production credentials\n\nFor personal projects and learning? Perfect.\nFor production with secrets? Stay on paid solutions.\n\nThis isn't paranoia. A Firebase misconfiguration just leaked 300M conversations from an AI chat app this week. Free doesn't mean careless.\n\nMy actual setup\n\n\u2022 Daily coding: Aider + free Nvidia models (95% of my work)\n\u2022 Critical production: Claude Code with Opus (when I need frontier reasoning)\n\u2022 The rule: if it touches real user data or credentials \u2192 paid. Everything else \u2192 free.\n\nMonthly savings: ~$180.\n\nThe $0 vibe coding starter kit\n\n1. Install UV + Aider (2 minutes)\n2. Get free Nvidia API key (1 minute)\n3. Clone a repo, run aider, start building\n4. Graduate to paid only when you genuinely need it\nYou have zero excuses not to code with AI in 2026. The tools are free. The models are good enough. The only cost is your time learning the workflow.\n\nStop paying rent to Anthropic for side projects.\n\n#ClaudeCode #FreeCoding #VibeCoding #AI",

    "text": "I argued with some clowns on Reddit that you can build the same weather trading bot on Kalshi with OpenClaw, just shorter and cleaner.\n\nThey said it will never beat Polymarket.\nMy take is simple: weather on Kalshi is less crowded, and the settlement source is rigid, so if you have better inputs you are not \u201cguessing\u201d, you are just pricing faster.\n\nKalshi weather markets settle off the National Weather Service final daily climate report, usually published the next morning.\n\nThat matters because you can build rules around one clean reference, not vibes, not tweet forecasts.\n\nSo I did it the boring way.\nStarted in the Kalshi demo environment, grabbed API keys, and wired OpenClaw to pull markets and stream the book over WebSockets. \n\nExecution is just the Create Order endpoint and a cancel loop, nothing fancy. \n\nData layer is where the edge lives.\n GFS runs 4 times per day at 00, 06, 12, 18 UTC. \n\n NBM updates once per hour, and the short horizon guidance is issued hourly.\n\nThat is enough cadence to front run the crowd on tight temperature buckets.\n\nThen you do the one calc that matters.\n\nIf the model says 82% for a bucket, fair price is 82c. If Kalshi is trading it at 58c, you are staring at 24c of edge per share before fees and slippage. \n\nThat is a real gap, not a \u201cmaybe\u201d.\n\nFees are why most people still lose.\n\nKalshi taker fee is round up of 0.07 times C times P times 1 minus P, maker uses 0.0175. \n\nAt 100 contracts around 50c, taker fee is about $1.75, maker is about $0.44, and rounding punishes tiny sizes. \n\nSo the bot either posts as maker, or it does not trade.\nMy rules stayed strict the whole night.\n\nShort expiry only, enough depth, post only orders, small size, hard cap per market, and if the book tightens the bot cancels instead of chasing. \n\nIf the edge is big, it can just hold to settlement and avoid paying exit fees twice.\n\nWill it beat Polymarket every day. Fuck knows.\n\nBut I\u2019d rather fight fewer bots with better inputs than fight the whole CT swarm on the same stale forecast.",

    "text": "I slept on the floor for 6 years or so, either on a folded duvet or a yoga pad. For the first two years I also stopped using pillows. \n\nI first got started after reading a paper called \"Instinctive sleeping and resting postures\" that was getting shared at the height of primal health discourse circa 2018. I just wanted to see if I could do it, and after struggling with it for a couple of weeks, it became natural. I had some mild shoulder pain from sitting too much that went away. It felt like I would just black out when sleeping. I felt rested but not relaxed.\n\nAfter the first month, I tried going back to a mattress but I just couldn't fall asleep, it felt too soft and unsteady and so for the next few years I kept the habit. Around that time, I found a fair amount of primal health content, much of it questioned the validity of chairs and other \"sitting devices\" as the default mode of being. Standing desks and such were also growing in popularity. \n\nI got rid of all my chairs and built a coffee-table-height wooden desk for my laptop needs, and did most of my work there or standing. I started doing mobility exercises after reading about Ido Portal's work too. I was at my most mobile and flexible at the time.\n\nThen I got a job and a relationship and the social aspects of mobility came to the forefront. This was before covid and I worked at a bank. I got reprimanded for trying to work standing up, and my then-girlfriend was not thrilled about the whole floor mattress situation, let alone the no-mattress version.\n\nSlowly I started using chairs again, then a pillow, then a bed. I still mix it up and have a strong preference for reading on the floor, but Bryan Johnson-esque \"health-minded\" habits tend to require forming your own bubble or eschewing most standard forms of socialization",
