# Trump Military Strikes - Day of Week Analysis

**Research Request:** Pattern analysis of Trump military escalations by day of week
**Hypothesis:** Strikes timed for Fridays to minimize market disruption (weekend buffer)

## First Term (2017-2021) - Major Military Actions

| Date | Day | Event | Timing Notes |
|------|-----|-------|--------------|
| April 6-7, 2017 | **Thursday→Friday** | Syria Shayrat airbase (59 Tomahawks) | Ordered Thurs night EST; missiles hit ~4:40 AM Friday Syria time |
| April 13, 2018 | **Friday** | Syria strikes (Douma response) | Joint US/UK/France, ~9 PM EST Friday |
| October 26, 2019 | Saturday | Al-Baghdadi raid | Special ops raid, not airstrike |
| January 3, 2020 | **Friday** | Soleimani drone strike, Baghdad | Early morning local time (Thursday night EST) |

## Pattern Summary

**Airstrikes specifically:** 3/3 occurred on Friday or late Thursday rolling into Friday
- Shayrat: Thursday night order → Friday morning impact
- Douma response: Friday night
- Soleimani: Friday local / Thursday night EST

**The al-Baghdadi raid** was Saturday, but:
- Raids ≠ airstrikes (different optics, less market-moving)
- Saturday announcement still gave markets weekend buffer

## Market Logic

**Why Friday?**
1. **Weekend buffer** — 48-72 hours for dust to settle before Monday open
2. **News cycle burial** — Weekend coverage is lighter, story ages before Monday
3. **Options expiration** — Major options expire Fridays; post-close timing avoids gamma squeeze chaos
4. **International response time** — Adversaries can't escalate into live US markets

**Counter-pattern:** If this were random, you'd expect ~1/7 (14%) to fall on Friday. Instead: 3/3 major airstrikes = 100% Friday-adjacent.

## Second Term (2025-Present)

| Date | Day | Event | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|-------|
| March 20, 2025 | **Thursday** | Yemen/Houthi strikes | Trump bombs Houthi rebels, issues Iran ultimatum |

**Pattern update:** The Yemen strike was Thursday — one day earlier than first term's Friday pattern, but still within the "late week" window. Thursday night US → Friday morning Middle East timing is possible (similar to 2017 Syria).

**Combined record: 4/4 strikes on Thursday-Friday (100%)** vs 29% expected if random.

## Content Angle for Deacon

**Post thesis:** "Trump times his airstrikes for Fridays. Here's why that's smart market strategy."

**Supporting points:**
- 3/3 major airstrikes in first term = Friday or Thursday night
- Weekend provides buffer for markets to digest
- Shows deliberate financial/strategic coordination, not impulsive action
- Counter-narrative to "unpredictable Trump" framing

**Caution:** This is observational pattern from 3 data points. Correlation, not proven causation. But 3/3 is notable enough to post about as a pattern worth watching.
