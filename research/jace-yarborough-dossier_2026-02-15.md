- **John Jay Institute** for Faith, Society and Law — Fellow
- **Club for Growth Foundation** — Fellow
- **Federalist Society** — President of Stanford Law chapter; former board member, Dallas Lawyers Chapter
- **Texas Public Policy Foundation** — Former intern (during UT Austin)

### Saint Francis Academy (The "Homeschool Apparatus")

Jace and Elizabeth Yarbrough co-founded **Saint Francis Academy**, a low-cost classical Christian school in **Sanger, TX**, approximately two years before his 2024 Senate campaign (est. ~2022).

- **Model:** Classical Christian education using the **Charlotte Mason method**
- **Schedule:** Tuesdays/Thursdays, 9 AM – 3 PM; outdoor classes
- **Structure:** Year-long, three-term academic calendar
- **Philosophy:** Collaborative; rooted in Christian faith; emphasizes parental involvement
- **Website:** saintfrancis.academy
- **Context:** Elizabeth Yarbrough is a former public school teacher (middle school choir). They homeschooled their first children, then founded the academy to serve other families. This is not a "homeschool co-op" per se but a hybrid classical Christian school — students attend in-person two days/week and do home-directed study the other days.

This directly ties to Yarbrough's **school choice advocacy** — he supports education funding that "follows the child" to public, private, homeschool, or online options. He criticized Governor Abbott's school choice plan as including "a massive, multi-billion dollar giveaway to the Texas public school bureaucracy."

### Key Policy Positions

| Issue | Position |
|-------|----------|
| **Border Security** | Create a Texas Border Protection Unit; arrest and deport illegal crossers; finish the border wall; mandate E-Verify; ban hostile nations from owning TX land |
| **School Choice** | Fund education by letting dollars follow the child — public, private, homeschool; opposes bloated public school bureaucracy spending |
| **Pro-Life** | Only exception: life of the mother; has represented Texas Right to Life; fought abortion travel funding |
| **2nd Amendment** | Strong supporter; oppose federal interference |
| **Election Integrity** | Restore AG's power to prosecute election fraud; deployed to Detroit in 2024 as election integrity attorney for Trump |
| **Religious Liberty** | Core issue; suing Air Force over religious speech punishment; fights DEI mandates |
| **Anti-DEI/Woke** | Challenges DEI initiatives in military and institutions |
| **COVID Vaccine Mandates** | Refused vaccine; fought mandates for first responders; represents SF first responders fired for refusal |
| **Gambling Expansion** | Opposes casinos and sports betting |
| **Foreign Land Ownership** | Ban hostile foreign ownership of American property |

### 2024 Texas Senate Race (SD-30) — Background

- Filed last day before deadline (Dec 2023) for **TX Senate District 30** (open seat after Sen. Drew Springer retired)
- Four-way primary: Yarbrough (33.4%), Brent Hagenbuch (37.7%), Carrie de Moor, Cody Clark
- **Lost runoff** to Hagenbuch on May 28, 2024
- Challenged Hagenbuch's residency eligibility in court (Hagenbuch lived outside district)
- Outspent significantly (Hagenbuch had ~$170K cash vs. Yarbrough's ~$56K) and faced endorsements from Gov. Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, and Trump (all for Hagenbuch)
- Despite losing, built strong grassroots coalition and name recognition

### Endorsements (2026 Congressional Race)

**Highest-Profile:**
- **President Donald Trump** (endorsed February 4, 2026 via Truth Social) — *This is the defining endorsement in this primary*

**Congressional/State Officials:**
- U.S. Rep. Keith Self (R)
- State Rep. Brent Money (R)
- State Rep. Wesley Virdell (R)
- Former State Rep. Matt Krause (R)

**Organizations & Groups:**
- Dallas Young Republicans
- Rockwall Young Republicans
- Multiple conservative grassroots organizations, 2A groups, pro-life groups, children/family advocacy groups

**2024 Senate Race Endorsements (carried-over credibility):**
- Texas Right to Life
- Grassroots America: We the People
- True Texas Project
- Former TX GOP Chair Lt. Col. Allen West
- Former State Rep. Matt Schaefer
- Cody Clark (primary opponent who endorsed him for runoff)

### Campaign Finance (2026 Congressional Race)

| Metric | Amount | As Of |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Receipts** | $325,183 | Dec 31, 2025 |
| **Disbursements** | $2,291 | Dec 31, 2025 |
| **Cash on Hand** | $322,893 | Dec 31, 2025 |

*Note: Very low disbursements suggest campaign launched late and is banking cash for the final push. The Trump endorsement (Feb 4) likely triggered significant additional fundraising not yet reported.*

## 2. Current Race: TX-32 Republican Primary

### District Overview

Texas' 32nd Congressional District was **dramatically redrawn** in August 2025 redistricting:

- **Old district:** Compact, Dallas-based seat; Baseline **D+22**; held by Rep. Julie Johnson (D)
- **New district:** Stretches from Dallas suburbs deep into **conservative East Texas**; Baseline **R+17**
- **Rating:** Moved from **Solid Democratic to Solid Republican** — this is a guaranteed Republican pickup
- **Incumbent:** None (Julie Johnson running in new TX-33)
- **The primary IS the election** — whoever wins the Republican primary wins the seat

### The Republican Primary Field (9 candidates)

**Top-Tier Candidates:**

1. **Jace Yarbrough** — Trump-endorsed constitutional lawyer (see above)
2. **Ryan Binkley** — Pastor/businessman; former 2024 presidential candidate
3. **Paul Bondar** — Businessman (insurance); ran in Oklahoma CD-4 in 2024
4. **Darrell Day** — Business owner; 2024 Republican nominee for old TX-32

**Lower-Tier Candidates:**

5. **Aimee Carrasco** — $34,575 raised; $1,334 cash on hand

8. **James Ussery** — No FEC filings
9. **Abteen Vaziri** — $15,225 raised; $8,337 cash on hand

**If no candidate gets >50%, top two advance to runoff on May 26, 2026.**

## 3. Opponent Breakdown

### Ryan Binkley — The Self-Funder

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Background** | Born 1967 in Columbus, GA; CEO of Generational Group (mergers & acquisitions firm); Senior Pastor of Create Church, Houston |
| **Previous Race** | Ran for **2024 Republican presidential nomination**; withdrew Feb 27, 2024 after poor results |
| **Receipts** | **$1,258,717** (likely significant self-funding) |
| **Cash on Hand** | **$640,665** |
| **Key Message** | National debt crisis; fiscal responsibility; "strategic plans and wisdom" for financial challenges |

**Strengths:**
- Massive fundraising / self-funding capability
- Name recognition from presidential run
- Dual business/pastor background appeals to evangelicals
- Was first major Republican to announce for this seat

**Weaknesses:**
- **No Trump endorsement** — in a MAGA district, this is devastating
- Presidential run was a vanity campaign (never gained traction)
- Based in Houston, not in the district — carpetbagger vulnerability
- Comes across as establishment/corporate rather than grassroots fighter
- His presidential campaign spent heavily and went nowhere

**Attack Vector Against Yarbrough:** Likely to argue Yarbrough is a late entrant riding the Trump endorsement; may highlight that he (Binkley) has actual business experience.

### Paul Bondar — The Carpet-Bagger

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Background** | Businessman in insurance industry |
| **Previous Race** | Ran for **Oklahoma's 4th Congressional District** in 2024; lost to incumbent Tom Cole 65%-26% |
| **Receipts** | **$1,905,588** (highest in the race) |
| **Cash on Hand** | **$1,608,960** (highest in the race) |
| **Key Message** | "Americans are getting a raw deal"; America First; "stop selling out our citizens" |

**Strengths:**
- Most money in the race by far — likely self-funded
- Can flood airwaves

**Weaknesses:**
- **Ran in OKLAHOMA last cycle** — massive carpetbagger problem; KFOR ran a story titled "Paul Bondar is running for Congress again—but not in Oklahoma"
- Lost badly to an incumbent (65-26)
- No Texas roots; no district ties
- No Trump endorsement
- Spending efficiency questionable — $1.9M raised but only $297K disbursed

**Attack Vector Against Yarbrough:** Likely to go heavy on paid media; may try to out-MAGA Yarbrough without the endorsement to back it up.

### Darrell Day — The Veteran Candidate

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Background** | Business owner |
| **Previous Race** | **2024 Republican nominee** for TX-32 under old (D+22) district lines; lost to Julie Johnson (D) 61%-37% |
| **Receipts** | $89,811 |
| **Cash on Hand** | $141,168 |
| **Key Message** | "The MAGA candidate"; Bible and Constitution; "honesty, common sense and proven conservative leadership" |

**Strengths:**
- Only candidate who actually ran in this district before (albeit old lines)
- Positions himself as the original MAGA candidate in the race
- Has existing voter file/contacts from 2024

**Weaknesses:**
- Lost his 2024 race by 24 points (even though district was D+22, the margin was large)
- Very limited funding
- **No Trump endorsement** — was the Republican nominee and Trump didn't endorse him
- May split the "I was here first" vote but can't match Yarbrough's credentials

**Attack Vector Against Yarbrough:** "I was the nominee when nobody else was willing to run here. Yarbrough is a Johnny-come-lately."

### Minor Candidates

**Aimee Carrasco, Gordon Heslop, Monty Montanez, James Ussery, Abteen Vaziri** — All significantly underfunded with no major endorsements. Unlikely to impact the race except by potentially pulling enough votes to force a runoff.

## 4. Opposition Talking Points Against Yarbrough

### From the 2024 Senate Race (Recycled Attacks)

1. **"Insubordinate to the military"** — Hagenbuch attacked Yarbrough for refusing the COVID vaccine, criticizing military culture while in uniform, and running counter to Air Force commands. *In the current MAGA-dominated environment, this likely plays as a strength, not a weakness.*

2. **"False accusations and opposition packets"** — During the 2024 primary, anonymous "websites and packets" were circulated with alleged false information about Yarbrough. He referenced these in interviews but specifics are murky.

3. **"Never held office"** — Lost his only prior race (SD-30 runoff). No legislative record to run on.

### Potential 2026 Attack Vectors

1. **"Late entrant / Trump endorsement chaser"** — Announced campaign ~January 17, 2026 (late compared to Binkley/Day). Could be portrayed as opportunistically jumping in after redistricting and securing the Trump nod.

2. **"Stanford lawyer, not a regular Texan"** — Despite his rural upbringing, opponents may portray him as an elite lawyer who went to Stanford and worked at fancy firms (Baker Botts, Quinn Emanuel).

3. **"Never won an election"** — Lost SD-30 runoff in 2024. Zero electoral victories.

4. **Active lawsuit against his own branch of military** — While this plays well with the base, some voters may see suing the Air Force while still serving in the Reserves as problematic.

5. **Residency/Newcomer to district** — Lives in Sanger (Denton County). The redrawn TX-32 stretches from Dallas suburbs into East Texas. May face questions about district ties.

### Known Vulnerabilities

- **No legislative record** — pure first-time candidate
- **Lost his previous race** despite grassroots support
- **Low cash relative to top opponents** — $323K vs Bondar's $1.6M and Binkley's $641K
- **Academic pedigree** (Stanford) may not resonate in rural East Texas portions of the district

## 5. Court Cases & Legal Battles Since 2020

### Case 1: Yarbrough v. Department of the Air Force (Religious Liberty / Free Speech)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Court** | U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas |
| **Filed** | October 2023 |
| **Representation** | First Liberty Institute + Winston & Strawn LLP + Ave Maria School of Law Veterans Law Clinic |
| **Status** | **Active** — Motion to dismiss DENIED (September 2025); proceeding to merits |

**Summary:** In early 2021, Yarbrough delivered remarks at a friend's (SMSgt Duane Fish) retirement ceremony at the Battleship Missouri Memorial in Pearl Harbor. In his speech, he quoted Alexander Solzhenitsyn ("let the lie come, but not through me"), warned about politicization in the military, and advocated for honesty/integrity. A Navy service member complained about the speech's content. The Air Force issued Yarbrough a **Letter of Admonishment (LOA)**, which negatively impacts his career. After exhausting administrative appeals, he sued in federal court seeking to have the discipline rescinded. The court denied the government's motion to dismiss in September 2025, allowing the case to proceed. **This is the marquee "fighting the radical left" case.**

### Case 2: In re Jace Yarbrough (Residency Challenge — 2024 SD-30 Race)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Court** | Texas Second Court of Appeals (Fort Worth) |
| **Case No.** | 02-23-00492-CV |
| **Year** | 2024 |
| **Status** | Concluded |

**Summary:** Yarbrough and fellow primary candidate Carrie de Moor challenged opponent Brent Hagenbuch's residency eligibility for the SD-30 Senate race. They alleged Hagenbuch fabricated residency in the district. The challenge was ultimately unsuccessful — Hagenbuch went on to win the runoff and general election.

### Case 3: Texas Right to Life v. City of San Antonio (Abortion Travel Funding)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Role** | Counsel for Texas Right to Life |
| **Issue** | City of San Antonio designated ~$500K in taxpayer funds for abortion travel |
| **Status** | Litigation ongoing/resolved (details limited) |

**Summary:** Yarbrough's firm represented Texas Right to Life challenging San Antonio's allocation of taxpayer dollars to fund travel from Texas to pro-abortion states for abortions. Part of a broader wave of litigation after *Dobbs*.

### Case 4: San Francisco First Responders (COVID Vaccine Religious Discrimination)

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Role** | Counsel for plaintiffs |
| **Issue** | First responders fired by City/County of San Francisco for refusing COVID-19 vaccine on religious grounds |
| **Status** | Active/ongoing |

**Summary:** Yarbrough represents former San Francisco first responders who were terminated for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. The suit alleges religious discrimination.

### Case 5: COVID Vaccine Mandate — Personal (Air Force)

Yarbrough personally refused the military's COVID-19 vaccine mandate. He fought the mandate through military channels. This overlaps with but is separate from the retirement speech case. His personal refusal and the discipline he received are part of his broader narrative of standing up against government overreach.

## 6. Additional Context

### Media Presence & Messaging Style

- **X/Twitter:** @JaceYarbrough — bio references Claremont Institute; describes himself as "Husband, dad, 7gen Texan, Air Force vet"
- **Campaign Videos:** Combative, firebrand tone. Key quote: *"We are in a cold civil war. It's time to start acting like it, to go on offense, to take ground, to hold the high ground, and to advance the conservative principles we know are good for our communities."*
- **Interview Style:** Articulate and policy-heavy; sounds like a lawyer but can connect on personal narrative (rural upbringing, blue-collar family, military service)
- **Media Coverage:** Featured in Daily Signal, Texas Scorecard, Texas Horn, Blue Ribbon News, NBC DFW, Texans for Vaccine Choice, Dallas Express, Current Revolt

### Relationship to GOP Establishment vs. Grassroots

**Firmly grassroots/populist wing** with elite credentials:

- In 2024 SD-30 race, he ran **against** the establishment candidate (Hagenbuch had Abbott, Patrick, and Trump endorsements)
- His endorsers were grassroots organizations (True Texas Project, Grassroots America, Texas Right to Life)
- His intellectual formation is through the **Claremont Institute / Federalist Society / ADF pipeline** — the intellectual architecture of the New Right / "national conservatism" movement
- He's a **Club for Growth Foundation fellow** — combining free-market economics with cultural conservatism
- The 2026 Trump endorsement flips the script: he's now the establishment-backed candidate while maintaining grassroots credentials
- His law firm (S|L Law) explicitly describes itself as fighting for "traditional rights" against "overreach from both state and private actors"

### Notable Quotes

> *"I'm stepping into the arena because President Trump needs reinforcements in DC to help deliver on his promises to the American people – and keep the radical left from taking us backwards toward a distorted vision of America."*

> *"President Trump's election in 2016 was a huge turning point in my own political understanding. I was in law school at the time, and got to see firsthand the radical left's response to that election."*

> *"Gov. Abbott's school choice plan to empower some Texas parents was commendable, but it included a massive, multi-billion dollar giveaway to the Texas public school bureaucracy."*

> *"I've been in tough fights to secure jobs, end religious discrimination, and protect life in Texas."*

### 2024 Election Integrity Deployment

In November 2024, Yarbrough **volunteered to deploy to inner-city Detroit as an attorney** to combat voter fraud and help protect Trump's victory in Michigan. This is a significant credential for MAGA voters.

### Key Vulnerabilities Summary

1. **Never won an election**
2. **Stanford pedigree** could be used against him in populist attacks
3. **Cash disadvantage** vs. Binkley and Bondar
4. **No legislative record** — all promise, no track record of governing
5. **Lives in Denton County** — district knowledge of East Texas portions may be questioned
6. **The speech controversy** — while it plays well for him, the actual content of his remarks at the retirement ceremony could be scrutinized (complaints alleged targeting of LGBTQ community)

### Key Strengths Summary

1. **Trump endorsement** — in a R+17 district, this is close to dispositive
2. **Military service** (ongoing) — genuine veteran credentials
3. **Elite legal credentials** deployed for conservative causes — not just talk
4. **Founded a school** — walks the walk on education
5. **Compelling personal narrative** — rural Texas, blue-collar family, Stanford, military, father of five
6. **Battle-tested** from 2024 SD-30 race
7. **Intellectual depth** — Claremont/FedSoc/ADF pipeline gives him serious conservative intellectual backing

---

## 7. Door-Knocking Pitch Summary

### The 30-Second Pitch

> "Jace Yarbrough is endorsed by President Trump. He's a seventh-generation Texan, Air Force veteran, Stanford-trained constitutional lawyer, and father of five who's spent his career fighting the radical left in court — taking on vaccine mandates, defending religious liberty, and protecting the unborn. He founded a Christian school with his wife. President Trump endorsed him because he needs reinforcements in Congress, and Jace has proven he'll fight."

### Key Differentiators vs. Opponents

| vs. Binkley | vs. Bondar | vs. Day |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| Trump endorsement ✓ | Trump endorsement ✓ | Trump endorsement ✓ |
| Actually fights in courts, not just talks | Not a carpetbagger from Oklahoma | Has the funding and endorsements to win |
| Grassroots warrior, not a CEO/pastor | Has real Texas roots (7th generation) | Didn't lose by 24 points |
| Military service (active Reserve) | Military service | More compelling candidate profile |

### Objection Handling

**"He's never held office"** → "That's the point. He's not a career politician. He's a veteran and lawyer who's been fighting for our values in the courts. Trump endorsed him because he wants fighters, not politicians."

**"He lost his last race"** → "He ran against the entire establishment — Abbott, Patrick, and even Trump endorsed his opponent. Now Trump has seen what Jace is made of and endorsed HIM."

**"He went to Stanford"** → "He went to Stanford and made them miserable standing up for conservative values. He was president of the Federalist Society there. He took the fight behind enemy lines."

**"I'm voting for Binkley/Day"** → "Both are good men, but only one candidate has President Trump's endorsement, and that's Jace. Trump knows we need a fighter in Congress, not just another politician."
