I'm one of the most advanced users of OpenClaw.

OpenClaw + GPT5.3 Codex + Opus 4.6 has been the trifecta that changed everything.

I made a video going over everything I'm doing with these tools.

3 THINGS YOU NEED TO BUILD IMMEDIATELY WITH OpenClaw:

1. Activity feed
2. Calendar
3. Global search

All 3 will super power your workflow

• Activity feed actively tracks everything your OpenClaw does. This is critical, because if you have it working autonomously, this will https://t.co/oYZh3POHBj

Use this prompt in OpenClaw to create your own AI agent command center that syncs up your life like Tony Stark's Jarvis in Iron Man. Adapt the specifics (agent names, data sources, branding) below to your own setup.

Tony Stark didn't prompt Jarvis every time.

Neither should you. 

Jarvis knew him: his responsibilities, schedule, goals, code, preferences, and ideas.

So I built the same initialization system for @openclaw.

One conversation to make your AI understand you.
