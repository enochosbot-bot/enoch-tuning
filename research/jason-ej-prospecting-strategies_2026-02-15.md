# Jason Brownstein — EJ-Compliant Prospecting Strategies
## Date: 2026-02-15

### Context
Jason is a CFP at Edward Jones. Needs individual investors (not businesses). Heavy compliance restrictions: no custom LinkedIn content, restricted lead lists. Currently door-knocking, LinkedIn DMs, calling businesses.

### Strategies Sent (ranked by risk)
1. **Neighborhood Intelligence Play** (Low) — public records research before door-knocking
2. **Life Event Monitor** (Low) — daily monitoring of probate, home sales, business transfers
3. **Community Anchor Strategy** (Low) — host workshops, co-host with CPAs/attorneys, volunteer orgs
4. **LinkedIn Warm Intro Engine** (Medium) — connect + comment strategy, cross-reference with property data
5. **Referral Multiplier** (Low) — systematic referral tracking and quarterly touchpoints
6. **Strategic Relocation Play** (Medium) — welcome notes to new homebuyers
7. **Personal Brand Play** (Gray) — personal social media only, never mention EJ

### Key Insight
All strategies are labor-intensive without AI — that's why most advisors don't sustain them. The agent automates the research and follow-through.
