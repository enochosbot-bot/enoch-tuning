## SCRIPT

### ACT 1 — THE PROBLEM
**[Screen: Simple title card — "What If We Could Get 2 Hours Back Every Day?"]**

Here's something we all know but don't talk about enough.

How much of your day is spent on actual advisory work — talking to clients, building plans, thinking strategically? And how much is spent copying data between Redtail and eMoney? Sorting emails? Filling out the same forms? Digging through SharePoint for a document you know exists but can't find?

I started tracking it. On an average day, I spend about 3 hours on work that a well-trained assistant could do. That's 15 hours a week. Across the whole team — we're probably losing 60-80 hours a week to administrative friction.

That's not a complaint. That's just the math. And the math means there's an opportunity.

**[Screen: "60-80 hours/week lost to manual data work across 9 people"]**

The systems we use — Redtail, eMoney, Orion, Outlook, SharePoint — they're good at what they do individually. But they don't talk to each other. We're the integration layer. We're the ones copying client addresses from one system to another, reformatting data for reports, sorting through 100 emails to find the 5 that matter.

What if we weren't?

### ACT 2 — THE SOLUTION
**[Screen: Live demo or screen recording]**

This is an AI agent. Not ChatGPT — not a chatbot you ask random questions. This is a persistent assistant that lives on a dedicated computer, connects to our tools, and executes tasks autonomously.

Let me show you what I mean.

**[Demo 1: Email Triage]**
Every morning, this agent scans my inbox. It categorizes emails by urgency and type — client requests, compliance notices, newsletters, spam. It labels everything, archives the noise, and gives me a prioritized summary. What used to take me 45 minutes to an hour now takes about 5 minutes of review.

**[Show: Before/after of inbox — messy vs. sorted with labels]**

In production environments, firms are seeing a **78% reduction** in email triage time. That's not theoretical — that's measured.

**[Demo 2: Calendar + Client Coordination]**
I can message the agent: "Schedule a review meeting with the Johnsons next week, send them a confirmation email, and add prep notes to their Redtail record." One sentence. Three systems updated. No tabbing between apps.

**[Demo 3: Report Generation]**
Weekly KPI reports that used to take 4-6 hours of pulling data from multiple systems? The agent collects everything, formats it, and distributes it automatically. **4 hours becomes 5 minutes.**

**[Demo 4: Cross-System Sync]**
The big one. Client updates their address in one system — agent propagates it to the others. New client onboarding paperwork comes in — agent creates the records across Redtail, eMoney, and SharePoint. What currently takes 3-4 hours of admin work per new client? **15 minutes.**

**[Demo 5: Meeting Prep & Form Auto-Fill]**
This is the one that changes the game.

You're in a client meeting. You're taking notes — or the agent is listening and taking notes for you. Before the meeting is even over, the agent has already started working. It pulls the client's info from Redtail, pre-fills the forms — account applications, transfer paperwork, beneficiary changes, whatever came up in the conversation. By the time you hang up the phone or walk the client out, the paperwork is drafted and waiting for review.

Think about what that means. Right now, after a meeting, you sit down and spend 30 minutes to an hour filling out forms, pulling account numbers, copying addresses, entering beneficiary details — all information that already exists in our systems. The agent does that in seconds. You just review, approve, and send.

**[Screen: "Meeting ends → Forms pre-filled → Review & send. Not 30 minutes later — immediately."]**

That's not a small thing. That's the difference between finishing your follow-up while the conversation is still fresh versus stacking tasks that pile up by end of week. No more "I'll get to that paperwork later." It's already done.

**[Demo 6: Teams as Your Command Center]**
Here's where it all comes together.

Right now, when you need to look something up, you open Redtail. When you need a report, you open Orion. When you need a plan, you open eMoney. When you need a document, you dig through SharePoint.

What if you just asked? In Teams — the app you already have open all day.

"What's the Johnson's account value?" → Agent pulls it from Orion.
"When was their last review?" → Agent checks Redtail.
"Add a note that they want to increase contributions to the 401k." → Agent writes it to Redtail.
"Pull their financial plan summary." → Agent grabs it from eMoney.

One interface. Every system. No more tabbing between four apps.

And here's the important part — we're not replacing Redtail. Redtail is our compliance-compliant system of record. Regulators expect it, Orion integrates with it natively, and our audit trail lives there. What we're doing is putting an intelligent layer on top of it. The agent reads from Redtail, writes to Redtail, keeps everything in sync — but you never have to manually enter data again. Redtail has over 100 API endpoints built exactly for this kind of integration.

**[Screen: "Teams chat → Agent → Redtail / Orion / eMoney / SharePoint. One interface. Every system."]**

You stop being the integration layer between your tools. The agent is.

The key insight: this isn't replacing anyone or any system. It's eliminating the manual work of moving data between systems — so we can spend more time on the work that actually matters. More client conversations. More strategic planning. More of what we got into this business to do.

### ACT 3 — SECURITY & COMPLIANCE
**[Screen: "But Is It Safe?" — address it head-on]**

I know what you're thinking. We're an RIA. We handle sensitive client data. We have compliance obligations. So let me address this directly.

**First: The data never leaves our building.**
This isn't a cloud service. The AI runs on a computer we own, on our network. Client data doesn't get sent to OpenAI or Google or anyone else. It stays on our hardware.

**Second: It's fully auditable.**
The software is open-source — MIT licensed. That means anyone can inspect the code. In fact, CrowdStrike — the largest endpoint security company in the world — published a full security analysis of it. They wouldn't do that for a toy. They did it because enterprises are deploying it and need to know how to secure it properly.

**Third: We control the access.**
The agent only connects to what we tell it to. We define the boundaries — which systems, which folders, which actions. Full audit logs for every action it takes. We can review everything it does.

**Fourth: Other financial firms are already doing this.**
Multiple agencies and advisory firms are running this in production right now, with security hardening and compliance controls in place. We wouldn't be first movers — we'd be fast followers with a proven playbook.

### ACT 4 — THE NUMBERS
**[Screen: ROI breakdown]**

Let's talk money.

**Cost of the software:** Zero. It's open source.
**Cost of the AI models:** About $30 a month. That's for the whole firm — not per user.
**Compare that** to commercial alternatives: ChatGPT Team is $25 per user per month. Enterprise AI assistants run $50-200 per user. For 9 people, that's $225 to $1,800 a month. We'd pay $30.

**[Screen: Cost comparison chart]**

Now the savings.

| Task | Time Before | Time After | Weekly Savings |
|------|------------|------------|----------------|
| Email triage | 2 hrs/day | 25 min/day | 8+ hrs |
| Client onboarding | 3-4 hrs each | 15 min | 3+ hrs |
| Weekly reports | 4-6 hrs | 5 min | 4+ hrs |
| Data sync | 1-2 hrs/day | Near zero | 5+ hrs |

Conservative estimate: **15-20 hours saved per week** across the team.

At a blended rate of $50/hour, that's **$750-1,000 per week**. Over a year: **$39,000-52,000** in recovered productivity.

For $360 a year in costs.

**That's a 100-140x return on investment.**

**[Screen: "$360/year → $39,000-52,000 in savings. 100-140x ROI."]**

### ACT 5 — THE ASK
**[Screen: "The Proposal"]**

I'm not asking us to overhaul everything overnight. Here's what I'm proposing:

**Phase 1 — Pilot (2 weeks)**
I run it solo. Email triage, calendar management, basic document retrieval. I report back with real numbers from my actual workflow.

**Phase 2 — Expand (2-4 weeks)**
If the pilot works, we add one more person. Connect SharePoint. Test with Microsoft Teams so the whole team can interact with it naturally.

**Phase 3 — Full Rollout (Month 2-3)**
All advisors. Redtail and eMoney integrations. Automated reporting. Client onboarding workflows.

Low risk. Low cost. High upside.

The tools exist. Other firms are using them. The question isn't whether AI will change how advisory firms operate — it's whether we want to be ahead of that curve or behind it.

I'd rather be ahead.

## PRODUCTION NOTES

### Visual Assets Needed
- [ ] Title cards (clean, professional — Spectrum branding if available)
- [ ] Screen recordings of live demos (email sort, calendar, reporting)
- [ ] Before/after inbox screenshots
- [ ] ROI comparison chart (simple bar chart)
- [ ] Cost comparison graphic
- [ ] Implementation timeline graphic

### Demo Recordings to Capture
- [ ] Email triage in action (inbox → sorted → summary)
- [ ] Calendar event creation via message
- [ ] Report generation (data pull → formatted output)
- [ ] Cross-system sync example
- [ ] Meeting → auto-filled forms (show notes being taken → forms populated in real-time)
- [ ] Teams chat queries ("What's the Johnson's account value?" → instant answer from Orion/Redtail)
- [ ] Teams → Redtail auto-fill (add note, update contact, create activity — all via chat)

### Talking Points for Q&A
- "What if it makes a mistake?" → Audit logs, human-in-the-loop for anything client-facing, start with low-risk tasks
- "What about our compliance requirements?" → Data stays local, full audit trail, no third-party data sharing
- "Who maintains it?" → Once configured, runs autonomously. Updates are one command. I'll own it initially.
- "Is this replacing anyone?" → No. It's replacing the tasks nobody enjoys. Everyone keeps their job — they just do more of the interesting parts.
- "What if the AI company goes under?" → Open source. The code exists forever. Community of 150,000+ contributors.
