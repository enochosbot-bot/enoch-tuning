**Title:** "I Built an 11-Tab Financial Model in 10 Minutes. The $20/Month Tool That's About to Change How We Work."

## Summary

Demo of Claude (Opus 4.5) integrated directly into Microsoft Excel, building a complete 11-tab financial model covering every ZIP code in the U.S. in ~10 minutes at $20/month.

## Key Claims
- **Structural awareness** — Claude reads tabs, formulas, and dependencies at the cell level
- **Proprietary data access** — licensed partnerships auto-populate analyses (LSCG, Moody's, S&P Capital IQ, FactSet, Morningstar, PitchBook)
- **Prebuilt agent skills** — DCF, comps, and other finance-specific tools packaged by Anthropic

## What It Does Well
- Rapid multi-tab model generation
- Suggests analyses you might not think to run
- Automatic edits that preserve formulas
- Transparent change trail for auditing

## Limitations
- Context window limits can force chat resets (Claude can usually infer and continue)
- Niche datasets sometimes need manual pasting
- Charts are functional but need manual polish
- Very large builds can max out the conversation

## Strategic Takeaways
- AI competition shifting from model benchmarks → **workflow integration + exclusive data partnerships**
- Anthropic + Microsoft relationship creates coopetition (cloud deals vs. alternative models in productivity suites)
- Workflow integration + licensed data may be the durable moat
- Massive implications for finance, FP&A, and analyst work

## Relevance
Directly relevant to Spectrum Advisors — this is the kind of Excel/financial modeling automation that could transform retirement planning workflows. Worth watching for the office AI presentation.
