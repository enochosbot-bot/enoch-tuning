## TERM 2 (2025-Present) — NEEDS COMPLETION

### Confirmed:
| Date | Day | Event | Source |
|------|-----|-------|--------|
| 2025-03-20 | **Thursday** | Yemen/Houthi strikes | AF show archive |

### The 12 Day War (June 2025) — NEEDS CLARIFICATION
| Date | Day | Event | US Role? |
|------|-----|-------|----------|
| 2025-06-12 | Thursday | War begins — Israel attacks Iran | ❓ |
| 2025-06-18 | Wednesday | US deploys massive force | Deployment, not strike? |
| 2025-06-23 | Monday | Ceasefire declared | — |

**QUESTION:** Did US conduct kinetic strikes during the 12 Day War, or was it Israeli ops with US support/deployment only?

### Current Iran Strikes (Feb-Mar 2026) — NEEDS DATES
| Date | Day | Event | Source |
|------|-----|-------|--------|
| ??? | ??? | Iran strikes (ongoing) | @officialrnintel |

**Context from AF archive:**
- 2026-02-17: Second aircraft carrier en route
- 2026-02-18: US assembles largest force since Iraq War
- 2026-02-19: "10 day countdown to US-Iran war"
- 2026-02-26: Iran talks collapse, "war imminent FOR REAL"
- 2026-02-28+: Strikes ongoing (per Deacon)

## DATA NEEDED FROM @officialrnintel

1. **Current Iran strike dates** — exact dates of US strikes (Feb 28 - present)
2. **12 Day War US involvement** — did US conduct airstrikes or just deploy/support?
3. **Any other Term 2 US military actions** — did I miss anything?

---

## MARKET STRATEGY ANGLE

**The Pattern:**
- Term 1: 100% of airstrikes on Thursday-Friday
- Term 2: Yemen strike on Thursday (pattern continues)
- Current Iran: TBD

**Why Thursday-Friday?**
1. Weekend buffer — 48-72 hours before Monday market open
2. Options expiration cleared (major options expire Friday)
3. News cycle burial — weekend coverage is lighter
4. Adversary response time — can't escalate into live US markets
5. Futures can price in over weekend before cash markets open

**The Thesis:** Trump isn't chaotic — he's the most market-aware military strategist in modern presidential history. Every major strike is timed to minimize market disruption.
