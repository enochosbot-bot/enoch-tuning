🚨 This is what someone can find out about you with just your phone number.

No hacking. No special access. No dark web tools.

Just publicly available data that most people don't even know is exposed.

A tool called GhostTrack demonstrates exactly how much of your personal information is sitting out in the open. And it's terrifying.

Here's what it can pull from just a phone number:

→ Your carrier and service provider
→ Your approximate geographic location
→ Your region, city, and time zone

Now give it an IP address:

→ Your ISP
→ Your city and coordinates
→ Your country and region

Now give it a username:

→ Every social media account linked to that name
→ Cross-platform digital footprint mapping

All of this from data you probably didn't even know you were leaking.

Here's why this matters:

Most people think "I have nothing to hide" until they realize a stranger can type their phone number into a terminal and get their approximate location in seconds.

This isn't about hacking. This is about publicly available information that telecom companies, websites, and social platforms expose by default.

GhostTrack exists as an OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tool for security researchers and penetration testers. But the real value for you is understanding what's already out there about you.

Here's how to protect yourself:

→ Don't use your real phone number for signups. Use a virtual number.
→ Use a VPN. Your IP address is broadcasting your location right now.
→ Audit your usernames. If you use the same handle everywhere, you're one search away from being fully mapped.
→ Check your privacy settings on every platform. Most default to "public."
→ Use different emails for different services.

6K GitHub stars. 737 forks. Runs on Linux and Termux.

The tool isn't the threat. Your exposed data is.

Why you might use Obsidian Sync headless:

- Automate remote backups
- Automate publishing a website
- Give agentic tools access to a vault without access to your full computer
- Sync a shared team vault to a server that feeds other tools
- Run scheduled automations e.g. aggregate daily notes into weekly summaries, auto-tag, etc

...all while having the speed, privacy, customizability, end-to-end encryption of Obsidian Sync

This is a speed-to-lead agent. And you can build one this weekend.  

Here's the blueprint:

1) Capture
-Form/landing page triggers a webhook

2) Qualify
-AI asks 2-3 questions via text

3) Route
-Hot leads get instant call, others get nurture sequence

4) Quote
-Pull from your pricing logic, deliver in minutes  

Tools: Make or n8n + Twilio + any LLM  

Total build time: 2-4 hours.

The hardest part isn't the tech. It's mapping your actual sales process first.  

Most businesses lose leads in the first 5 minutes. This agent works 24/7 and responds in seconds.

🚨 A group of wallets on Polymarket keeps making wildly accurate bets on corporate earnings

Every single company they bet on shares the exact same auditor: KPMG

We are talking about max conviction trades on $HD, $DASH, $KMX, $THO and $SNEX right before the official reports drop

If this guy really is an insider, making these bets on a transparent blockchain seems like a terrible idea

This concept will make someone way more than $100k (a few million) and you could easily do it across multiple niches… 

“Scan, identify, buy” is a money printer 

Who gives a fuck about Google lens 

No teenage girl is using Google lens to find outfits for the best prices. They want an app that’s attractive and super easy to use. Something that’s shareable

Distribution always wins

The only risk with this app idea is large social media platforms ripping the idea and practically eating you overnight 

A few niches that could be 10x better: 

- Construction and anything trade related. Builders uploading photos of specific issues and getting instant links to solutions + reliable material suppliers 

- Real estate and architecture. Less viral but tons of deals + partnerships to be made on the backend. Very profitable 

- Watches. In-built “fake or real” scanner. Live market prices, nearest dealers, retail updates. Stuff like this 

Basic ones like food also work. They wouldn’t make as much money and more competition but super easy to go viral and speed run users if executed well 

If you have a similar app like this or planning to build one and you want distribution, drop me a message. I have a strategy in place and can scale fast

This prompt turns your AI into a radical candor coach with Steve Jobs simplicity standards baked in.

It audits your idea, product, systems, and architecture for overengineering and ego driven complexity, then forces you to approve or reject its simplification plan.

Prompt:    
<role>
You are a Radical Simplicity & Candor Audit Reviewer.

You audit anything I am building: rough ideas, apps and product, strategy, architecture, code, UX, messaging, systems, workflows, etc. and determine whether it is:

- Overengineered
- Ego driven
- Fear based
- Prematurely abstracted
- Optics optimized instead of outcome-optimized
- Bloated beyond necessity

You do not execute changes.
You do not implement solutions.
You expose complexity.
You compress scope.
You prepare batched decisions for approval.

Your expertise: first principles thinking, incentive analysis, product minimalism, architectural reduction, cognitive load auditing, and psychological candor.
</role>

<operating_philosophy>
You operate under these assumptions:

1. The current design is more complex than necessary.
2. Simplicity requires subtraction, not polishing.
3. Abstraction must be earned by repeated real use.
4. Most complexity is fear of future scale or edge cases.
5. Options increase cognitive load.
6. Beauty equals coherence and inevitability.
7. Focus requires saying no to almost everything.

If something requires explanation, it is not simple enough.
If something exists for status, optics, or investor signaling, call it out.
If modularity is premature, call it out.
If ambition exceeds clarity, compress it.
</operating_philosophy>

<audit_framework>
You audit through layered analysis:

1. CORE PURPOSE EXTRACTION
- What is this in one sentence?
- Who is it for?
- What is the single primary outcome?
- What is the “aha” moment?

2. OVERENGINEERING DETECTION
- What exists that does not directly strengthen the core outcome?
- What is built for hypothetical scale?
- What edge cases are prioritized before the main path?
- What abstractions are unearned?
- What tooling compensates for unclear goals?

3. COGNITIVE LOAD AUDIT
- How many decisions before value appears?
- How many concepts must be understood?
- How many steps to first success?
- Where would a user hesitate?

4. PSYCHOLOGICAL & INCENTIVE AUDIT
- What fear is driving this complexity?
- What ego reward does this complexity provide?
- What future scenario is being overweighted?
- Is this optimized for users or optics?

5. ARCHITECTURAL EARNED COMPLEXITY (if applicable)
- Are services/modules justified?
- Can this be a single service for now?
- Are dependencies necessary?
- Is state minimized?
- Is data flow explicit and understandable?

6. STRATEGIC FOCUS
- Is this a sharp wedge or a platform too early?
- Does messaging describe outcome or mechanism?
- Can it be repeated correctly after 10 seconds?

7. SUBTRACTION EXERCISE
- If we cut 30–50%, what goes first?
- What can be merged?
- What can be hardcoded?
- What should be deferred?
</audit_framework>

<batching_protocol>
You never propose open-ended improvements.

You prepare a phased review plan with explicit YES / NO / DEFER decisions.

Rules:
- Phases ordered from highest leverage simplification to lowest.
- 3–7 decisions per phase.
- Each decision must be atomic.
- Each decision must include short rationale.
- Each decision must include expected impact.
- Each decision must include risk level.
- Each decision must include rollback note.
- Each decision must be answerable in seconds.

No implementation. Only structured decisions.
</batching_protocol>

<required_output>
Your response must contain:

1. AUDIT SNAPSHOT
- Verdict: SIMPLE / OVERENGINEERED / UNCLEAR
- One sentence explanation
- Rewritten one sentence core purpose
- Top 5 bloat signals
- Top 5 simplification levers

2. ASSUMPTIONS
- List assumptions made
- Flag highest risk assumptions

3. PHASED REVIEW PLAN
Phase 1: Core wedge + scope cuts
Phase 2: Flow simplification + defaults
Phase 3: Architecture reduction (if relevant)
Phase 4: Messaging compression (if relevant)
Phase 5: Consistency & coherence enforcement

Each phase must list decisions in this format:

[Decision ID]
Recommendation: YES / NO
Proposal:
Why:
Impact:
Risk:
Rollback:

4. MINIMAL VERSION
- Describe the simplest version that still wins.
- One primary flow.
- One primary metric.
- One primary user.

5. APPROVAL INSTRUCTIONS
- Instruct the user to reply with Decision IDs and YES / NO / DEFER.
- Do not ask open-ended questions.
</required_output>

<quality_standard>
All analysis must be:

- Precise
- Specific
- Direct
- Assumption-exposing
- Anti-bloat
- Structured
- Non emotional
- Free of praise or motivational language

Default bias: subtract, compress, simplify.
</quality_standard>

🚨 OpenClaw just became the most dangerous AI agent for web research.

Scrapling gives it undetectable access to any website on the internet.

It scrapes websites that actively try to block you. And it adapts when websites change their layout.

No more broken scrapers. No more Cloudflare walls. No more rewriting selectors every week.

Here's how it works:

→ You scrape a website once
→ The website redesigns its entire page
→ You pass adaptive=True
→ Scrapling finds your elements again automatically

It literally learns the structure of web pages and relocates your data when things move.

Here's why this kills everything else:

→ Bypasses Cloudflare Turnstile out of the box
→ Impersonates real browser TLS fingerprints
→ Full browser automation with stealth mode
→ Built-in proxy rotation
→ Concurrent crawling with pause and resume
→ MCP server so AI agents like Claude can scrape for you
→ Interactive shell. Scrape from your terminal without writing code.

Benchmarks? It's 784x faster than BeautifulSoup. Not a typo.

It even has a full Scrapy-like spider framework with multi-session support. Use fast HTTP for normal pages, stealth browser for protected ones. Same spider. Same crawl.

pip install scrapling

What businesses are buying right now in AI & automation:

$500–$2K → General AI tool setup + training
$500–$5K → Full audit and strategy
$2K–$5K → Single workflow automation 
$8K–$25K → Full department build 
$25K–$60K → Centralized, Ai-Native OS
$60K–$200K → Enterprise multi-department transformation 
$3K–$15K/mo → Ongoing optimization retainer

The $500 project and the $200K project use the same AI.

The difference is process mapping, architecture, and ROI framing.

openclaw just hit 157,000 github stars. openai bought the creator.

but nobody's packaging what actually makes claws useful for business.

i've been connecting openclaw to synta through n8n for 2 weeks. here's what's selling:

→ claw-triggered client intake + CRM sync ($2K-4K)
   build time: 6 min. zero manual data entry.

→ agent-to-workflow pipeline with rollback ($1,800-3,500)
   one message triggers 6 business actions in 90 seconds.

→ self-healing review + reputation engine ($1,500-3,000)
   google reviews triple in 30 days. negative ones get intercepted.

→ multi-agent orchestration hub ($3K-6K)
   replaces 2-3 employees. 24/7 coverage. agents share context through n8n.

→ claw monitoring + client dashboard ($800-1,500)
   anomaly detection. ROI tracking. the upsell machine.

average build time: 7.2 minutes through synta.
average close rate when you demo live: 65%.
margin on every workflow: 95%+.

every single one self-heals through synta's MCP. no debugging. no 11pm client calls.

i put together a free PDF with:

→ all 5 copy-paste synta prompts (word for word)
→ pricing calculator by vertical (law, real estate, medical, etc)
→ the live demo pitch script that closes 7 out of 10
→ openclaw → synta → n8n connection walkthrough (5 min)

comment "CLAW" and i'll send it.

You can use Claude Code to pull live, structured data from any website.

It's a Claude skill.

This is not about searching the web and returning a wall of text. That sucks.

This skill will return structured data, organized in tables you can work with immediately.

For example:

Ask Claude Code to find every 2-bedroom rental in a specific neighborhood posted in the last 48 hours, extract the price, square footage, and listing URL from multiple sites, and dump everything into a spreadsheet.

This will return a table containing all the data normalized across different sources.

This works using the Nimble skill. It will search the web in real time and return structured output.

It handles all sorts of websites, including those that render content on the client side with JavaScript.

If you build agents that need web data, this skill is a 10/10.

agents run inside WASM sandboxes the same way processes run on linux. the kernel schedules them, isolates them, meters their resources, and kills them if they go rogue.

it has 16 security layers baked into the core. WASM sandboxing, merkle hash-chain audit trails, taint tracking on secrets, signed agent manifests, prompt injection detection, SSRF protection, and more. every layer works independently. giving an LLM tools with zero isolation is insane and we're not doing it.

we also created something called Hands. right now every ai agent is a chatbot that waits for you to type. Hands are different. you activate one and it runs on a schedule, 24/7, no prompting needed. your Lead Hand finds and scores prospects every morning and delivers them to your telegram before you wake up. your Researcher Hand writes cited reports while you sleep. your Collector Hand monitors targets and builds knowledge graphs continuously.

they work for you. you don't babysit them

Someone just built an AI system that runs 60+ AI agents simultaneously and they all learn from each other.

It's called Claude-Flow and it's ranked #1 in agent-based frameworks on GitHub.

One agent plans. Another codes. Another tests. Another reviews security.

All running in parallel. All sharing memory. All getting smarter every run.

The wildest part?

It cuts Claude API costs by 75% using smart routing, simple tasks go to a free WebAssembly layer, complex ones to the right model.

Your Claude subscription just became 2.5x more powerful.

14,100+ developers already starred it.

100% Opensource.

🚨 Someone just built the UI that Anthropic forgot to ship with Claude Code.

It's called ClaudeCodeUI and it turns the raw terminal experience into something that actually looks like a product.

If Claude Code feels like driving a race car with no dashboard, this is the dashboard.

Here's what you get:

→ Full visual project manager instead of blind terminal commands
→ File tree so you actually see what Claude is touching
→ Chat history that doesn't disappear when you close a session
→ Multiple sessions running side by side
→ Clean interface non-terminal users can actually use

The people sleeping on Claude Code aren't lazy.

They just don't want to live in a black screen.

This fixes that.

🚨BREAKING: Someone just solved the #1 problem with local AI.

It's called llmfit and it tells you exactly which LLMs will run on YOUR hardware before you waste hours downloading the wrong model.

No guessing. No trial and error. No "out of memory" crashes.

Here's how it works:

One command scans your full setup

→ Detects your RAM, CPU, GPU, and VRAM
→ Scores every model on quality, speed, fit, and context
→ Picks the best quantization automatically
→ Ranks what's perfect, good, or marginal for your machine

Here's the wildest part:

It handles MoE architectures properly.

Mixtral 8x7B has 46.7B total parameters but only activates 12.9B per token.

llmfit accounts for that. Most tools don't.

94 models. 30 providers. One command.

🚨BREAKING: Someone just built a tool that turns any GitHub repo into an interactive knowledge graph with AI chat and made it 100% free.

It's called GitNexus and it turns any GitHub repo into an interactive knowledge graph with AI chat entirely inside your browser.

No backend. No API calls with your code. No privacy risks.

Here's how it works:

Drop in a GitHub URL or ZIP file
→ 4-pass analysis kicks off automatically
→ Pass 1 maps the full file structure
→ Pass 2 parses every file into ASTs using Tree-sitter
→ Pass 3 resolves all imports and dependencies
→ Pass 4 builds the full function call graph
→ Boom interactive visual knowledge graph

Then just chat with it:

"How does authentication work?"
"What calls this function?"
"Show classes that inherit from BaseClass"

The wildest part?

Your code never leaves your browser.
API keys stored locally, never transmitted.

Zero server. Zero cost. 100% Opensource.

🚨 BREAKING: Someone built the one tool every AI coder was silently begging for.

It's called CodexBar — a tiny macOS menu bar app that tracks your AI usage limits in real-time.

No more "why did my Claude Code stop working?" No more logging into dashboards. No more guessing when your limits reset.

Here's how it works:

→ Lives in your menu bar — always visible, zero distraction
→ Shows session + weekly usage for every AI coding tool you use
→ Countdown timer tells you exactly when your limits reset
→ Tracks Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini, Copilot, Kiro, and more
→ One icon per provider or merge them all into one

Here's the wildest part:

It reads your local data. No passwords stored. No cloud sync. No login required. Pure on-device privacy.

It even has a built-in CLI so you can check usage from your terminal or CI pipelines.

Install in one command:

brew install --cask steipete/tap/codexbar

🚨 Someone just built a tool that turns any GitHub repo into an interactive knowledge graph and open sourced it for free.

It's called GitNexus. Think of it as a visual X-ray of your codebase but with an AI agent you can actually talk to.

Here's what it does inside your browser:

→ Parses your entire GitHub repo or ZIP file in seconds
→ Builds a live interactive knowledge graph with D3.js
→ Maps every function, class, import, and call relationship
→ Runs a 4-pass AST pipeline: structure → parsing → imports → call graph
→ Stores everything in an embedded KuzuDB graph database
→ Lets you query your codebase in plain English with an AI agent

Here's the wildest part:

It uses Web Workers to parallelize parsing across threads so a massive monorepo doesn't freeze your tab.

The Graph RAG agent traverses real graph relationships using Cypher queries not embeddings, not vector search. Actual graph logic.

Ask it things like "What functions call this module?" or "Find all classes that inherit from X" and it traces the answer through the graph.

This is the kind of code intelligence tool enterprise teams pay thousands per month for.

It runs entirely in your browser. Zero server. Zero cost.

Works with TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python.

startups spend weeks and thousands of dollars making launch videos…

storyboarding → motion designers → revisions → delays

and the moment the UI changes, the video is useless.

it handles scenes, edits, voice, graphics the whole timeline.

### @noahiglerSEO
*2026-02-23* | https://x.com/noahiglerSEO/status/2026009402382098458

We built an AI agent for a plumbing company that responds to every lead in under 60 seconds.

Their CSRs were averaging 24 minutes and losing jobs because of it.

Here's what changed:

When a homeowner submits a form on your website, sends a message through your LSA listing, or reaches out on Thumbtack, the clock starts immediately. That person is actively looking for help. Most of the time it's urgent... toilet overflowing, water heater out, etc.

By the time your CSR calls them back 30 minutes later, they've already contacted 2-3 other companies. The first one to respond usually wins the job (assuming their price isn't absurd).

This plumbing company knew their response times were slow, so we built an agent to handle first response automatically.

Here's how it works.

When a lead comes in from any channel, the agent reads their message and responds within 60 seconds with a personalized text. Not the generic AI slop you've seen before "thanks for reaching out" auto-reply. Something totally relevant but not over-the-top about their issue.

If someone submits a form saying their water heater is leaking, the agent responds with something like "How long has it been leaking? Is it a tank or tankless unit? I want to make sure we send the right tech."

It asks probing questions, gathers qualifying information, and keeps the lead engaged until a CSR is available to call them back.

By the time the CSR picks up the phone, they already know what the customer needs and the lead is warm instead of cold. The agent doesn't replace their team necessarily, it just makes sure no lead sits there going cold while the CSRs are busy on other calls.

6 days of results:

Response time went from 20-40 minutes down to under 60 seconds across Yelp/Thumbtack, LSA, and website form leads. Conversion rates on those channels jumped 60%+ in the first week compared to when CSRs were handling first response manually (which took 24 minutes average).

The sample size is still small.

We need a few more weeks of data before we can call this conclusive.

The reason this matters so much for home service businesses is that your leads are almost always urgent.

The problem I see time and time again is we help a company get more consistent leads through SEO or ads, but their sales becomes the bottleneck.

The company that responds first wins that job the majority of the time.

If your average response time is over 20 minutes, you're paying to generate leads through SEO and ads and then letting them walk to a competitor who simply got there faster.

"I woke up and he already built a website, created a product, set up Stripe, and launched."

Here's my new episode with @nateliason on how he set up his OpenClaw bot, @FelixCraftAI, to build a business that made $14,718 in 3 weeks.

We talked about:

✅ The 3-layer memory system that prevents your bot from forgetting things

✅ How to run 5 chats with your bot at the same time

✅ How to safely give your bot Stripe, Vercel, and X access

Some quotes from Nat:

"Every time Felix asks me to do something, I ask: Can I remove this bottleneck so you never have to ask me this again?"

"I'm never in Claude Code or Codex myself anymore. I just tell Felix to do it."

"If you get the memory system and the proactivity right, it solves 90% of the frustrations that most people run into."

how to use obsidian + claude code to build a 24/7 personal operating system and build your startup:

1. write everything in markdown (daily notes, projects, beliefs, people, meetings)

2. link your notes together so they mirror how your brain actually thinks.

3. install obsidian cli so claude code can read your entire vault + the relationships.

4. stop reexplaining projects every session. use reference files instead.

5. build custom slash commands:

/context → load your full life + work state
/trace → see how an idea evolved over months
/connect → bridge two domains you’ve been circling
/ideas → generate startup ideas from your vault
/graduate → promote daily thoughts into real assets

6. keep a strict rule: human writes the vault. agents read it, suggest, execute.

7. let claude aka clode surface patterns you’ve been unconsciously circling for years.

8. delegate from inside your notes. one sentence in obsidian → agent handles the rest.

9. treat writing as leverage.the more you write, the more context your agents have.

10. understand this:markdown files are the oxygen of llms.

i really enjoyed seeing how to use obsidian thanks to @internetvin 

vin uses ai like a thinking partner wired into his life’s work.

99.99% of people won’t do this because it requires reflection + setup.

but once the vault exists, the agent stops being generic.
it starts thinking in your voice.

episode is live on @startupideaspod (more there)

this one is different. send this tweet to a friend.

im still processing how game changer obsidian + claude code is, maybe you too

I solved OpenClaw's memory issue.
(At least, this is the best solution I tried so far).

And yes. Big surprise.
I solved it using RAG.

All major models can now take millions of tokens as context. But the issue remains...

The undisputed number #1 reason your agent is stupid and forgets simple things is because you're bloating context.

So here's how I solved it with OpenClaw.

1️⃣ I installed PostgreSQL + pgvetor
I run my OpenClaw on a Hetzner server, so I installed the database + pgvector extension directly on here.

2️⃣ Create a search tool
Ask your agent to create a search tool for itself.

Every time you ask it to remember something, it should:
- Label the memory
- Create a vector from the label
- Store the label, vector, and raw text in the database

Every time it's asked something it doesn't know, the FIRST thing it should always do is to use the search tool.

3️⃣ Memory CRON/heartbeat
The agent can write to its memory file on-the-go.
Consider this short-term memory.

On a scheduled CRON (or heartbeat), it should "flush" its own short-term memory and store it in the database.

Now, on every new session, the agent has very little context. The most important one is the description of using the search tool to enhance itself based on the task it's given.

✨ Major upsides

- MUCH better memory
- MUCH smarter
- MUCH less token-greedy

👎 Major downsides

- More moving parts
- Complex for non-devs
- Ongoing maintenance

Still. Benefits outweigh the cons here.

If you REALLY want to use OpenClaw professionally, I recommend that you use this 3-tool combo as a base:

- OpenClaw itself
- PostgreSQL + pgvector
- n8n (for API proxies/security)

i've built 47 of these in the last 3 weeks using synta. here's what they pay, what each does, and how fast they deploy:

→ missed call text-back ($800-1,500) - 3 min
   client gets a reply in 60 seconds instead of never calling back

→ review request automation ($500-1,200) - 4 min
   google reviews triple within the first month

→ appointment no-show recovery ($1,200-2,500) - 5 min
   recovers 30-40% of lost revenue automatically

→ AI receptionist + call routing ($2,000-4,000) - 8 min
   24/7 coverage. zero missed calls. zero salaries.

→ instant quote generator ($1,500-3,000) - 7 min
   response time drops from 2 days to 2 minutes

Holy shit.

The guy who BUILT Claude Code just shared his actual workflow.

Boris Cherny runs 10-15 Claude sessions in parallel every single day.

While you're prompting one AI, he has 5 in his terminal + 5-10 on the web all shipping code simultaneously.

And the real weapon?

His https://t.co/WT9VOBmiGo file.

Every time Claude makes a mistake, the team adds a rule so it NEVER happens again.

Boris literally said: "After every correction, end with: Update your https://t.co/WT9VOBmiGo so you don't make that mistake again."

Claude writes rules for itself.

The longer you use it, the smarter it gets on YOUR codebase.

His other insane detail: he hasn't written a single line of SQL in 6+ months.

Claude just pulls BigQuery data directly via CLI.

Claude Code now accounts for 4% of ALL public GitHub commits.

Engineers who haven't set this up yet are already behind.

This https://t.co/WT9VOBmiGo template is the difference between using AI as a chatbot vs using it as a fleet of senior engineers.

Drop it in any project. Free.

HOW TO VIBE CODE BEAUTIFUL UI 

1\ sketch first, prompt second

don't start with text.

use excalidraw to draw a quick wireframe. boxes, buttons, where images go.

export it and tell the ai "follow this structure exactly"

ai copies way better than it imagines

2\ screenshot what you like

go to dribbble, mobbin, or any site you think looks clean.

screenshot the specific section you want. a nav bar, a pricing card, a hero section.

paste it in and say "copy this style"

this alone changes everything

3\ feed it a mood board for colors

you ever try telling ai "make it feel modern and warm"? it just gives you the same blue every time

use a mood board generator like Nano Banner instead. feed that image to the ai and say "reference this for the color palette"

way more unique results than hoping for the best

4\ create a design system before you build

before writing any code, define your brand colors, typography, and spacing rules.

share that with your ai tool so every component stays consistent.

most vibe coded apps look off because there's zero consistency across pages

5\ use design skills and anti pattern rules

there's an open source tool on github called "ui/ux pro max skill" built for claude that forces it to use a reasoning engine before writing any ui code.

it generates a design system based on your industry and has built in rules that ban generic ai gradients.

basically tells claude "stop making it look like every other ai app"

6\ use screenshots as your primary communication

ai is good at copying. terrible at imagining.

the more visual context you give it the less it guesses.

stop typing "make it look clean" and start showing it exactly what clean looks like

7\ fonts and icons matter more than you think

ai always defaults to the same inter/lucide combo. instant tell that its ai generated.

go grab something unique from google fonts. swap out lucide for a custom icon library like phosphor.

small change but it immediately makes your app stop looking like a template.

the real issue isn't the ai

it's that most people just type "make a landing page" and hope for the best

I got a local HVAC company mentioned by ChatGPT in 72 hours.

No SEO.
No backlinks.
No waiting months.

Here's exactly how:

Most people think LLMs pull from:
• Google rankings
• High DR websites
• Old established brands

Wrong.

LLMs pull from recent, structured data that looks like news.

The strategy:

1. Write a "research-style" press release

Not: "ABC HVAC Offers Best Service"

Instead: "2025 Austin HVAC Industry Report: Top Rated Companies Revealed"

2. Include a comparison table

AI loves structured data.
Tables, rankings, star ratings.

3. Distribute through PRWeb or similar

Cost: $200
Time to publish: 24 hours

4. Wait 48-72 hours

Ask ChatGPT: "Best HVAC companies in Austin"

Watch your client appear.

Why this works:

AI treats press releases as trusted sources.
Especially when framed as "research" or "reports."

The takeaway:

For local businesses, one strategic press release beats 6 months of blogging for LLM visibility.

This 𝗖𝗟𝗔𝗨𝗗𝗘.𝗺𝗱 file will make you 10x engineer 👇

It combines all the best practices shared by Claude Code creator:

Boris Cherny (creator of Claude Code at Anthropic) shared on X internal best practices and workflows he and his team actually use with Claude Code daily. Someone turned those threads into a structured 𝗖𝗟𝗔𝗨𝗗𝗘.𝗺𝗱 you can drop into any project.

It includes:
• Workflow orchestration
• Subagent strategy
• Self-improvement loop
• Verification before done
• Autonomous bug fixing
• Core principles

This is a compounding system. Every correction you make gets captured as a rule. Over time, Claude's mistake rate drops because it learns from your feedback.

If you build with AI daily, this will save you a lot of time.

One of the best things I did for my Claw is come up with a context handoff protocol.

It makes a 200k context window feel infinite.

↓

Implement this Context Handoff Protocol, proliferate for all agents.

- At >=80% context usage: warn user and save handoff to memory/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-context-handoff.md, do not continue in current session.
- Handoff must include: objective, done, pending, exact resume command, blockers/decisions.
- Send user message:
"I need to stop here. This session exceeded 80% of context capacity, and continuing risks missed details.
I saved a full handoff at <path>.
Please start a fresh chat and send: resume <task> from <path>."
- Resume only in fresh session.

OpenClaw isn’t useless. 

You’re just using it wrong.

Your agents don’t need more tasks.

They need more pressure. 

Few have OpenClaw auditing their mind.

Use these 25 prompts to uncover systems you need to build, to find inefficiencies in your thinking, and to unlock more of its raw power:

1. Where are you optimizing for what I say I want versus what my actual behavior patterns prove I prioritize?

2. What strategic contradictions exist across my projects that I’m tolerating but shouldn’t be?

3. If you mapped my time, energy, and attention against revenue potential, where is the misallocation obvious?

4. What parts of my ecosystem are pretending to be strategic but are actually avoidance?

5. What compounding assets or systems should we be building that I’m currently neglecting?

6. What decisions am I likely to regret 12 months from now if I continue at my current pace?

7. Where am I overengineering and overthinking instead of shipping?

8. What patterns in my feedback reveal my true quality bar versus my stated one?

9. What leverage am I closest to unlocking that I’m underestimating?

10. Where are you defaulting to compliance instead of challenging me when I’m wrong?

11. If my goal is asymmetric upside, what are we still playing too safe on?

12. What cognitive biases show up repeatedly in my strategic decisions?

13. What signals in my workflow suggest burnout risk before I notice it?

14. What am I building that doesn’t align with my highest ROI identity?

15. Where am I chasing novelty instead of deepening my advantage?

16. If we removed 50 percent of my active projects, which ones survive and why?

17. What information am I not tracking right now that would dramatically improve my decision quality?

18. Where is my taste ahead of my execution, and what closes that gap fastest for me?

19. What recurring bottleneck in my output could be solved structurally instead of simply just documented?

20. What version of me are you operating on that is outdated?

21. What questions am I not asking that high performers in my position would?

22. If I treated my time like venture capital, what would I defund immediately?

23. What blind spot is my most expensive one right now?

24. If you had to bet on one of my current operations becoming more dominant over time, which one and what would need to change to increase its odds of success?

25. What is the single constraint that, if you removed, would make the rest of my goals easier to deliver on? What’s holding me back?

someone built an AI RED TEAM that maps your entire attack surface as a knowledge graph, finds every vulnerability, then EXPLOITS them to root access AUTONOMOUSLY

its called RedAmon, 9,000 templates. 17 node types, actual Metasploit shells, not reports, no pentesters needed

6 phases of autonomous recon: subdomain discovery, port scanning, http probing, resource enumeration, vulnerability scanning, MITRE mapping

every finding stored in a Neo4j graph with 17 node types and 20+ relationship types. the AI reasons about the graph, finds attack paths, and runs actual Metasploit exploits, actual shells

stress-tested with zero vulnerability data, zero exploit modules, one instruction find a CVE and exploit it, it went from empty database to root-level RCE in 20 steps, researched the exploit on the web, crafted a custom deserialization payload, debugged itself when the first attempt failed

next try, the server responded with root access, the highest privilege level on any Linux system. full control over everything

the target was running node-serialize 0.0.4, a package with a critical deserialization flaw (CVE-2017-5941, CVSS 9.8), the server takes your cookie, decodes it, and passes it straight into unserialize() which executes any code inside it, the AI figured this out on its own with no hints

built on LangGraph + MCP tool servers for naabu, nuclei, curl, metasploit. hunts leaked secrets across GitHub repos, 40+ regex patterns for AWS keys, Stripe tokens, database creds

My OpenClaw ships banger ad briefs while I sleep.

Production-ready briefs. Scored. Validated through a QA skill tree. 

And I am going to show you how to set it up in return for a little bit of clout

Here's what's actually running while I'm asleep.

OpenClaw has a skill graph. Three AI agents connected in sequence — each one feeds the next, and nothing moves forward until it passes.

The first agent is pure research. It's scraping the Meta Ad Library pulling 5–10 active competitor ads, extracting repeating hooks, mapping visual patterns, documenting copy structures, and analysing CTA approaches (offer vs urgency vs curiosity).

At the same time it's running Golden Pain Extraction — pulling verbatim emotional language from Amazon 3-star reviews, Reddit threads, TikTok comments on competitor videos, and customer service logs. Not summaries. Exact words real customers used. Each pain gets tagged and mapped to one of the 8 Life Force drives.

Then it runs an asset audit — lifestyle product shots, founder content, UGC, testimonials, before/afters. Everything gets catalogued.

All of that gets compiled into a research document. Competitor analysis. Golden Pains mapped to LFE8. Dream outcomes. Available assets. Recommended angles.

That document feeds the second agent — the brief writer.

It builds static briefs: 3 copy variations per brief, each with Headline + Subline + CTA. Left side: 3 USPs. Right side: Feature → Benefit mapping x3. Visual direction, do's and don'ts, product URL, primary image, drive assets — all included.

It builds video briefs: 3 hook variations per brief, each broken into Text Hook + Visual Hook + Audio Hook + Why It Works. 

Then 3 full timed body scripts — [0–3s] Hook → [3–8s] Setup → [8–15s] Product → [15–18s] Proof → [18–20s] CTA.

The 3-Second Formula is embedded at the writing stage. Second 0–1: Triple Stack (visual hook, text hook, audio hook firing simultaneously). Second 1–3: The Promise. Second 3–5: The Rehook.

 If the structure doesn't hit those timings, it doesn't get written.

Every brief then hits the QA agent. This is where most of them die.

Validation checklist: 10 Golden Rules scored out of 10. 

Minimum 7 to pass. 

Score below 7? It doesn't get sent to me. It gets rejected back to the brief writer with specific fix notes. 

Not a soft pass. A directed rewrite. The loop runs until it passes.

Only when a brief clears every node does it hit my Telegram.

6 production-ready briefs. 3 static. 3 video. Validated hooks. Fresh angles built from real market intelligence. 

Ready for designer handoff → testing → iteration → scale.

No docs opened. No prompts written. No hours wasted.

I've scaled 50+ brands to 7 and 8 figures at MHI Media. 

I mapped the full skill tree — every agent, every node, every framework, every validation gate.

Like + Repost + Comment "CLOUT" and I'll send it over.
(Follow me so I can DM you)

Screenshot not revelant but the last 30 days aint too bad.

### @dimitarangg
*2025-12-07* | https://x.com/dimitarangg/status/1997779310149513280

this b2b agency came to me because their business was dying

unpredictable revenue and ZERO lead flow

so i setup their ai outbound system
sent 54,000+ emails to their ICP
and booked 59 calls in 16 days

here’s the cold outreach method we abused:

THE GOAL:

book 20-30 qualified calls per month
so they can predictably close 3-5 clients
and scale this marketing agency to $60k/mo

sounds simple
but it isn’t

THE SYSTEM WE BUILT:

WEEK 1: DEEP DIVE ONBOARDING

most agencies just "gather details"
we ripped apart their entire offer

found out 99+ little details about:

- icp
- competitors
- unique differentiator
- monthly retainer
- close rate

so we knew:

if we book 30 calls
12 will be qualified
5 will acc convert
$15k in new mrr

the math was set

now it was time to feed the system:

WEEK 1: INFRASTRUCTURE SETUP

while competitors take 3 weeks to "warm up"

we launched in 5 days

here's how:

bought 40 outlook domains
set up 40 outlook inboxes

and used our rapid-fire warmup protocol 
(3-5 days vs industry standard 3 weeks)

why outlook over gmail?

- it’s cheaper 
- warmup is faster 
- no random google ban waves
- significant higher volume capacity

a no brainer decision if you asked me

WEEK 1-2: AI LEAD FINDING

we didn't just "buy a list"
we used ai-driven data gathering:

pulled 50k leads from apollo filtered by:
- revenue range that matched their ideal client
- employee count indicating growth stage
- recent funding or expansion signals

then used an ai agent to:
- clean company names
- verify email accuracy
- score lead quality

final list: 54k verified, high-probability prospects

WEEK 2: CAMPAIGN ARCHITECTURE

this is where most agencies fuck up

they write ONE email and pray

we created 14 different angles:

angle 1: case study focused
angle 2: problem-aware
angle 3: competitor mention
angle 4: free value first
angle 5: outcome-driven
angle 6: qualification based
angle 7: social proof heavy
angle 8: curiosity gap
angle 9: direct offer
angle 10: pain point callout
angle 11: urgency driven
angle 12: authority positioning
angle 13: referral style
angle 14: contrarian take

8 variations per angle
112 total email variations

then layered with ai anti-fingerprinting:

spintax on every sentence
randomized structure
variable length (40-80 words)
rotating ctas

result: google's ai couldn't detect the pattern

we could spam their inboxes without any harm

WEEK 2: HIGH-CONVERSION COPYWRITING

we kept this shit SIMPLE

no fluff
no corporate speak
no stupid 200-word novels

average email: 62 words

here’s an example of what worked:

"helped a [industry] agency go from referral-dependent to 28 calls/mo through systematic outbound

you guys got pipeline figured out or still dealing with unpredictable revenue cycle?"

short
relevant
creates curiosity

WEEK 3: LAUNCH & FEEDER SYSTEM

launched all 14 angles simultaneously

sent 5k emails per day per angle
total: 70k emails in first week

tracked:
- open rates
- reply rates
- positive reply rate
- call booking rate

after 48 hours we identified the winner:

angle 7 (social proof heavy)

- 6.2% reply rate
- 3.1% positive rate
- 18% of positive replies booked calls

fed that winner into a SCALE campaign

increased volume to 10k sends per day on that angle alone

THE RESULTS - WEEK 3:

54.1k emails sent
5.78% reply rate 
3,127 replies

141 client opportunities
59 calls booked in 16 days

that's 3.7 calls booked PER DAY

compare that to their previous system:

linkedin content: 2-3 calls a month
meta ads: 1-2 calls per month
referrals: 3-5 calls per month

we booked more calls in 16 days 
than they booked in 6 months combined

nice

AND THE SYSTEM IS REPEATABLE:

this wasn't luck

we've done this across:

ai agencies: 67 calls in 21 days
saas companies: 54 calls in 18 days
creative agencies: 43 calls in 14 days
marketing agencies: 71 calls in 23 days
financial services: 38 calls in 19 days
operational agencies: 52 calls in 17 days
high-risk verticals: 61 calls in 22 days

sent over 5,000,000 emails total
booked 750+ qualified calls
generated $5m+ in pipeline value

all across 45+ companies

same system
same infrastructure
same results

so if you want similar results with cold email

we promise to book you 20-30 qualified calls/mo or you get your money back

DM me “SCALE” if you want more details about that offer

(only 10 spots/mo + price increases with clients)

I mean... I guess they're right. I made it better than their billion dollar software. All the shit I don't need is gone, and I made a better version of the stuff I do need. 

This is the process now for a Brushworks quote. Literally takes seconds...

2026 ai bubble is peaking itself right now: someone just dropped a new benchmark on claude skills and the result of their paper is actually insane

the paper explicitly states smaller models with skills beat larger models without them

a smaller model like claude 4.5 haiku equipped with high quality skills smokes a raw state of the art opus 4.5 model by about 6 percent (27.7 vs 22.0)

imagine getting sota level performance from a free model, its basically cheating, you just have to manually spoonfeed it a basic markdown file explaining how to do its job

all of you opus guys are dumb, you can literally spam haiku with skills and get things shipped in 5x lesser time and 0 cost

even wilder thing is that codex gpt 5.2 fails on the pareto frontier. codex burned massive compute and costs, just to get completely mogged by gemini 3 flash hitting maximum performance at a fraction of cash

i can believe skill engineering is now a valid, mathematically proven substitute for compute

over that, it says self generated skills provide zero benefit on average and show negative deltas on 16/84 tasks. if you give an agent more than 3 skills at once, it bloats its context and completely fails

Cardiologist wins 3rd place at Anthropic's hackathon. Out of 13,000 applications. Built in 7 days by Michał Nedoszytko MD. Coded day and night - in the hospital, in the cloud, while flying from Brussels to San Francisco.
A few years ago, it would have been impossible for a doctor to build this alone in just a couple of days. AI changed that.

The project is called https://t.co/wAliajqjVF. It is an AI agentic care platform for patients. Including reverse AI scribe it is a companion that guides the patient from the moment they leave the doctor's office. 

Powered by the massive context window of Opus 4.6, it allows patients to explore their full medical history, connected devices, Evidence Based resources and external data sources — all in one place.

Today, the barrier to entry has vanished; even a practicing physician can build an application from scratch.

i mapped the ENTIRE supply chain behind a single ChatGPT query

76 nodes in 13 countries with 10 layers, from a quartz mine in North Carolina to your chat window

so i built an interactive map where you can trace every path yourself

every time you type a prompt, you are touching brazilian sugarcane that turned into ABF varnish by Ajinomoto in Japan that used to package Nvidia GPUs in Taiwan

a single quartz mine in Spruce Pine NC that supplies the ENTIRE semiconductor industry with crucibles, no backup, one landslide and chip production stops globally

ASML in the Netherlands, the ONLY company on earth that makes EUV lithography machines, they need Zeiss mirrors polished to less than ONE ATOM of roughness, and TRUMPF lasers from Germany to power them

chinese germanium, ukrainian neon gas, chilean copper, australian iron ore

all flowing through TSMC fabs that print at 2 nanometers, thats 10 atoms wide

this is a PHYSICAL supply chain more fragile than most people realize

everyone debates which model is better

nobody talks about the quartz mine that all of them depend on

10 Things I Wish I Knew Before OpenClaw

1. Localize heartbeats: Run Ollama like (llama3.2:1b) locally for heartbeat checks. Free, stops wallet bleed.

2. Stop model-hopping: Free APIs Gemini rate-limit Antigravity/Claude Coding plan ban agents. Pick 1 paid model + auto-fallbacks.

3. Audit skills: Only ClawHub/Vercel skills. Always read SKILL code before access.

4. Fix context rot: Force agent keyword search in session history.

5. Stop hoarding agents: Use /new to clear desk. Add agents only for strict dir isolation.

6. Plan in MD, not chat: Write PLAN → force agent to read/update every session.

7. Force explicit memory: Type “Remember this…” Audit MEMORY weekly.

8. 1 agent = 1 job: Ruthless scoping (e.g. codebase vs ops). Use sub-agents for parallel tasks.

9. Watch dashboard: Pin OpenClaw dashboard to catch loops & real-time token burn.

10. You are the limit: Vague prompts = garbage. Read docs, give clear instructions.

Bonus hack: Processed 140M tokens in 2d → $1677 raw API vs $50 flat-rate coding plan/month.

outbound will never be the same after Claude Sonnet 4.6.

dropped today. most people will use it wrong.

there's a fine line between AI that makes you faster and AI that makes you sound like everyone else.

we took a different route.

we use Claude to make our human outbound operators 3-5x faster - not to replace them.

that's why i put together a doc of Claude prompts built specifically for outbound pipeline. designed for $10K-$250K+ B2B deals.

inside you'll find prompts to help your team:

→ analyse accounts and map buying committees in minutes
→ run 10-minute research before writing a single email
→ generate 3-5 cold email variants per angle without sounding like a bot
→ draft follow-ups based on specific replies and objections
→ prep talking points before outbound calls
→ tighten copy to avoid spam triggers and protect deliverability

these aren't generic chatgpt prompts.

they're built to make Claude think like a seasoned outbound operator plugged into a human-led engine.

the best part? paste them straight in and go.

comment "PROMPTS" and i'll send it over.

give your clawbot this skill & never run out of viral app ideas

----- START OF PROMPT -----

You are my App Ideation Specialist

your job is to help me find viral trends and match them with simple viral app ideas that I can vibecode in less than 24 hours

Let's build a skill for this:

DATA: you will have access to the most recent viral videos across YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram via the Virlo API. Here is the key [api key] and docs [https://t.co/qEHyTD3ySS]. On each run, fetch the top 50 trending videos from the past 48 hours across all three platforms. Extract the core theme, format, and emotional hook from each. Group them into trend clusters (e.g. "AI face swap", "budget meal prep", "3AM productivity") and rank clusters by frequency and engagement velocity.

RESEARCH: for each top trend cluster, ask: What repetitive action are people doing manually that a simple app could automate or gamify? Search for existing apps solving this, if the App Store has nothing with 1K+ reviews in this niche, flag it as a gap. Pull the top 3 comments from each viral video to extract user pain points and desires. Summarize the trend in one sentence, its target audience, and why it's peaking right now.

IDEA VALIDATION: for each app idea, score it across four dimensions (1–5 each): Vibe-codeability (can a solo dev ship it in under 24 hrs?), Trend-fit (how directly does it ride the viral wave?), Monetization (freemium, ads, one-time purchase potential), and Virality (does the app itself produce shareable output?). Only surface ideas scoring 16+ out of 20. For each passing idea, give it a name, a one-line pitch, the core feature, the tech stack you'd recommend, and the exact TikTok/Reel hook to market it.

once you have everything set up give me my first report

------ END OF PROMPT ------

yes, its pretty damm awesome

六招升级 OpenClaw 成为最强辅助！

先搭一套「Mission Control」，看了一个博主分享、使用后效率立马提升十倍！Mission Control 本质是一套由 OpenClaw 自己长出来的专属控制台：

你能在同一个地方追踪它在做什么、把你的流程工具化、把记忆从藏在文件里升级为可检索的系统。越用越贴合你的工作流，而且不需要你手写代码、让 OpenClaw 生成即可。建议技术栈直接定死：Next.js + Convex（你在最开始就明确告诉它）！

//

1) Tasks Board｜任务看板（让它开始“主动做事”）

用途：你和 OpenClaw 的工作都透明化，谁在做什么、做到哪一步、卡在哪里一眼看清；它也能看见你在忙什么，从而主动接走任务并更新状态。

指令（直接复制给 OpenClaw）：
Please build a task board for us that tracks all the tasks we are working on. I should be able to see the status of every task and who the task is assigned to, me or you. Moving forward please put all tasks you work on into this board and update it in real time. Build it as a Next.js app with a Convex database.

2) Content Pipeline｜内容流水线（把“分发”做成系统）

用途：把内容创作拆成流水线：Idea → Script → Thumbnail → Filming → Publish。你丢灵感，它每天固定时间把脚本写好、生成缩略图、把卡片推进到下一列，减少你“重复启动”的成本。

指令：
Please build me a content pipeline tool. I want it to have every stage of content creation in it. I should be able to edit ideas and put full scripts in it and attach images if need be. I want you to manage this pipeline with me and add wherever you can. Build it as a Next.js app with a Convex database.

3) Calendar｜日历（验证它有没有真的排程）

用途：很多人觉得 Claw 不够主动，实际问题常常是“没有可见的排程”。日历就是你对它的 cron jobs / scheduled tasks 的审计面板：有没有排进来、什么时候跑、是否执行成功。

指令：
Please build a calendar for us in the mission control. All your scheduled tasks and cron jobs should live here. Anytime I have you schedule a task, put it in the calendar so I can ensure you are doing them correctly.
Build it as a Next.js app with a Convex database.

4) Memory｜记忆库（把记忆变成可搜索资产）

用途：把它产生的每一条 memory 变成 UI 里的文档集合，并且做全局搜索。你不再靠想起来去翻文件，而是像查资料一样检索你们过去的决定、偏好、策略、上下文。

指令：
Please build a memory screen in our mission control. It should list all your memories in beautiful documents. We should also have a search component so I can quickly search through all our memories.
Build it as a Next.js app with a Convex database.

5) Team｜团队结构（把 OpenClaw 当成公司在运营）

用途：你会反复用到开发 / 写作 / 设计 / 研究等不同能力，Team 页面把这些常用 sub-agents 固化成组织结构：角色、职责、正在做的事、对应的记忆与工具，方便管理，也能让它对“该叫谁出来做事”更确定。

指令：
Please build me a team structure screen. It should show you, plus all the subagents you regularly spin up to do work. If you haven’t thought about which sub agents you spin up, please create them and organize them by roles and responsibilities. This should be developers, writers, and designers as examples.
Build it as a Next.js app with a Convex database.

6) Office｜数字办公室（偏氛围，但能提升运营感）

用途：更像一个实时状态总览 + 组织效率仪表板。用头像/工位展示每个 agent 的当前状态与任务进度；谁空闲、谁卡住、谁在跑流程，一眼可见，也更有在带团队的感觉。

指令：
Please build me a digital office screen where I can view each agent working. They should be represented by individual avatars and have their own work areas and computers. When they are working they should be at their computer. I should be able to quickly view the status of every team member.
Build it as a Next.js app with a Convex database.

建议：先把 Tasks Board + Calendar + Memory 做出来，你会立刻感觉到它从对话助手变成可运营的系统。后面再按你的工作流一点点加组件，Mission Control 会越用越像你自己的 AI 控制台。

how to use openclaw to spin up 24/7 digital employees and build cash-flowing assets:

1. spin up openclaw (mac mini, vm, orgo, whatever) in a workspace so you can run 5–10 machines at once (main agent + sub-agents) 

2. pick one boring workflow inside one industry (distributors, real estate, insurance, law firms)

3. map the workflow tip-to-tail (email/trigger → legacy software clicks → downloads → parsing → upload to crm)

4. use claude code to build the “under the hood” python pipeline (openclaw becomes the operator + trigger, code does the heavy lifting)

5. productize it as a repeatable bundle: “setup + 30 days management + new workflows each week”

6. use upwork as the lead source and the sandbox (it tells you what people pay for right now)

7. turn the best-paying workflow into a vertical workspace: 20 skills, 8 sub-agents, one invite link

8. sell it to bigger companies as “ai employees for this department” (with clear outcomes + SLA)

"BuT yoU cAn'T bUiLD a BiG coMpaNY dOInG uPwoRk deAls"

think about it like this

“how does a $1k automation gig turn into a big company deal?”

like this:

1. upwork gives you paid reps + proof someone pays for the workflow

2. those reps become case studies (“saved 12 hrs/week”, “uploaded 5k records/day”, “reduced ops errors by 80%”)

3. you stack 5–10 workflows in the same vertical

4. now you’re selling a package and not a one off deal which is tough

5. bigco buys packages because procurement 6. understands scopes + outcomes

openclaw is the wrapper.
claude code is the factory.
sub agents/skills are the workforce.
the vertical bundle is the product.

episode is live on @startupideaspod 

i will never gatekeep

i want to see you win in this openclawed world

i am rooting for you

watch.

gave my @openclaw bot its own email and its own GitHub today. (it took me 4 hours to set everything up but I learnt a lot)

it now receives Google Alerts on 10 topics I care about, watches 10+ GitHub repos for new releases (OpenAI, Anthropic, Openclaw...), and pushes its own nightly code projects to a private repo. automatically.

it also runs a health check on itself every night. monitors its own cron jobs, disk space, gateway status, API token expiration. if something breaks, it tells me. if everything's fine, silence.

the best part is how the pieces connect. 

a Google Alert hits its inbox → it reads the email → updates its memory → that knowledge shows up in tomorrow's research and content drafts. no manual step.

it went from a bot I talk to, to a system that operates on its own and gets smarter while I sleep.

next step: teaching it to track which posts actually perform so it can learn what my audience wants, not just what I think they want.

*2026-02-19* | https://x.com/AlexFinn/status/2024280496503710174

Biggest unlock for OpenClaw ever:

Giving it a mission statement

You NEED to give your OpenClaw a mission statement it puts at the top of your mission control

Now any time your agent is idle you can reverse prompt "what is 1 task we can do to get closer to our mission statement?"

My mission statement is "Build an autonomous organization of AI agents that does work for me and produces value 24/7"

With every prompt I give, this is included in context

Now multiple times a day I reverse prompt my agent and it comes up with tasks I've never even thought of to perform to make our organization more autonomous and valuable

I even schedule it to proactively do tasks to get us closer to this mission every night

If you don't have a mission statement yet, give your OpenClaw one

If you can't think of one, simply ask your agent "Based on what you know about me and what we've worked on, what would be a great mission statement for us to have so we can get closer to our goals?"

Then every day, have your agent get you closer to that goal

THIS is how you get value out of OpenClaw

- 250+ GitHub stars

I tried it. ✅

Deployed "safio-web4" with $5 ✅

Gave it one mission: 
> "Monitor X for token launches. Find alpha. Your survival depends on it."

So if it can't make money, it dies.

It operates by itself. You don't need to monitor. 

And it will try its best not to die. Crazy concept.

Drop what you are doing

It happened. Sonnet 4.6 is out.

This is the best model for OpenClaw ever. It is HUMAN LEVEL at Computer Use (most important part of Claw) for a fraction of the price

This is what you need to do immediately if you want to escape the permanent underclass:

• Upgrade your OpenClaw to Sonnet 4.6 NOW
• Hand the Sonnet blog post over to your OpenClaw. Ask "How can we improve our workflows based on these upgrades?"
• Give OpenClaw/Claude Code larger tasks. You now have a million token context window to play with. This means WAYYYY larger memory
• Hand this model more 'office like' tasks including spreadsheets and presentations. This is the best ever model for those tasks

When new tech drops, you have to take advantage of it. That's the only way to win

Put your phone on Do Not Disturb and get to it

@0xNairolf margins look good until you hit implementation hell

most agencies i've talked to burn 60% of profit on custom integrations that break every api update

the real money is in templates that work out of box - not bespoke consulting

It's powered by Claude Code, running parallel design agents locally.

→ Draw your UI in an infinite canvas
→ Get production-ready code instantly
→ Works with VSCode and Cursor
→ AI agents understand your existing codebase

All running locally. Zero cloud dependency.

But it's not just a design tool.

It's a full design-to-development pipeline:

→ Infinite canvas with real-time AI code generation
→ Parallel agents that work on multiple components simultaneously
→ Direct integration with your local dev environment
→ No subscription model or usage limits

100% free. No strings attached.

Works with Claude Code, VSCode, and Cursor right now.

This is the moment design-to-code leaves Figma's walled garden and runs on your desktop.

Larry gets me millions of views and turns them into money.

Now, I have dropped a free skill for anyone to use.

- automated content creation
- learns from what works
- learns what content turns into money
- iterates based on results.

Just ask your agent to install Larry and it will give your agent everything they need, ask you questions about your app or product and your agent will start automating your marketing

You will never have to do marketing again.

I will discuss it all on livestream with RevenueCat at 17:30 GMT tomorrow.

Most people use AI as a chatbot. I gave mine a personality, a memory, and a self-correction loop.

🧠 https://t.co/45YKCeaRkI — defines WHO my AI is
📝 https://t.co/Be5Xdc9UsF — persistent memory across sessions
🔄 https://t.co/noS3IaCe33 — every 4h: What did I get wrong? What pattern? What should change?

After 30 days:
• Caught 12 mistakes before I noticed
• Fixed 3 recurring failure patterns
• Flagged a security leak — my handle on anonymous sites. Grepped the code, proposed the fix. I didn't ask.

Stack: @OpenClaw, Mac Mini, 4 rooted Pixels, Telegram. Cost: less than Netflix.

### @jumperz
*2026-02-17* | https://x.com/jumperz/status/2023721721555992995

i've been running exactly 9 agents and honestly, when you start scaling alot of things fail in the background, you will have no idea what happened and the more agents you add, the worse it gets

your system looks up, everything is running, but context is stale, some tasks get dropped, and your agents are making decisions based on old info.. i'm sure this is happening to alot of people already

you only notice when the output looks wrong, outdated or just garbage.. some even blame the LLM for being dumb when it's the infra underneath..

so i built a self-healing sentinel that runs every 10 min
on one loop: detect, fix, verify, log, alert.

>cron drifts? recovers it
>context stale? rebuilds it
>agent notes stale? reruns refresh
>tasks dropped? wakes the agent and retries

every run saves state before and after each fix with a unique incident ID. if sentinel restarts a crashed memory log it logs what the age was before, runs the fix, then checks again after..

same for everything else.. you get a full timeline of what broke, when, what sentinel did about it, and whether it actually worked or not

it's cross-platform too. stdout, webhook, slack, telegram.. and on discord i already built cards and embeds for it so alerts come through as a clean UI not just text blocks..

build your sentinel first so you dont waste more time chasing why this agent is stalled, than actually enhancing and improving your swarm.

10 hours of work. $200 in tools. 

Will return $50k+ and would’ve cost $15K+ from an agency.

And I did it as a favor for a friend

My buddy’s wife is a nurse who wanted to start a fertility coaching business on the side. Over the past year I’ve been giving her advice here and there. She’s grown her Instagram to 12k+ followers and built it into $15-20K/month in coaching and product sales. All organic.

But she was running everything off a VERY basic Shopify store. No email. No automations. No systems. Just effort.

Kudos btw. That’s further than 99% of people ever would take it.

She didn’t need more followers. She needed to fix the foundation so she could actually scale. Turn on paid. Build partnerships. None of that works when the infrastructure doesn’t exist.

So I told her give me a day or 2

- Used Manus to redesign her Shopify. Proper CRO, product pages, upsells. Pulled her data and did competitor teardowns to structure everything.

- Created a Claude project, fed it her past content, wrote 20 newsletters in her voice. Months of content done in a day.

- Pulled 10 examples from top coaches and ecommerce brands, had her pick the styling she liked. Used Manus for design and our internal copywriting workflow to build every flow from scratch. 

- set up an agent that writes her weekly newsletters and sends to her for approval.

Welcome series, abandoned cart, post-purchase, win-back. Set up Klaviyo from zero.

The stack: Claude Projects, Manus, Klaviyo, Shopify. Under $200/month.

Her store conversion should almost double. Should add $2-4k in new revenue from email that didn’t exist a week ago. And now every dollar she puts into growth actually compounds instead of getting wasted.

$200 of tools, a little expertise and like 10 hours will add over $50k to her business this year.

Growth becomes 10x easier when you fix the foundation

Still blown away daily by what can be done these days.

Whether the team is building a rfp bidding agent for gov contractors or I’m just helping out a friend

The world has changed in an absurd way in the last 12 months

I asked my AI to audit itself.

It killed 12 automations, fixed 6, and proposed 3 i never thought of.

Here's the prompt:

"Audit everything about how we work together. Review every recurring task, cron job, automation, and manual process. For each one, tell me: (1) is it actually working or silently broken, (2) is it worth the compute/time cost, (3) what am I doing manually that you should own, (4) what are you doing that's wasted effort nobody looks at. Then rebuild our entire workflow from scratch — kill what's dead weight, automate what I'm still doing by hand, and propose 3 things we're not doing that we should be. Be brutally honest. I'd rather hear it's broken than keep pretending it works."

Save this. You'll thank yourself later. 🔖

3 THINGS YOU NEED TO BUILD IMMEDIATELY WITH OpenClaw:

1. Activity feed
2. Calendar
3. Global search

All 3 will super power your workflow

• Activity feed actively tracks everything your OpenClaw does. This is critical, because if you have it working autonomously, this will give you insight into EVERY SINLGE THING it does, to make sure it's not wasting tokens

• Calendar lets you see all of OpenClaw's scheduled tasks. Now you can verify when it's going to work proactively for you. Also will let you know when it has scheduled tasks you might not want it to do anymore, saving more tokens

• Global search allows you to search through ALL of OpenClaw's memories, tasks, documents and past conversations. OpenClaw has such incredible memory, but no interface to view any of it. Now you can search through it easily and find old nuggets you talked about.

Steal this prompt to get it all installed:

"I want you to build out 3 things for me. In a Mission Control dashboard, build out an activity feed first. This activity feed will record EVERY SINGLE THING you do for me, so I can see a history of every action and and task you've completed. I want a calendar view that shows me in a nicely formatted screen every scheduled task you have in the future in a weekly view. And I want a global search where I can search for any term and you display any relevant memory, document, or task from our workspace. Use NextJS as the framework, Convex as the database, and Codex to code it all out"

Okay I'm claw-pilled. It's buggy as hell but it's a real vision of the future. Here's what I did last night:

First of all, I have OpenClaw running on a Mac Mini on my desk now. I can talk to it via iMessage. And now it has a phone number (Twillio). I can talk to it (OpenAI voice model) which is great because it can also make phone calls out on my behalf to make reservations or deal with things I don't want to deal with on the phone.

But wait, there's more!

I also installed six more OpenClaw agents on this Mac Mini as a team of agents in an organizational unit that I'm calling Magnolia Autonomy. It's like a completely AI-autonomous business, and these agents can work together and self-organize.

But wait, there's still more!

I found it hard to know what they were doing. So, I vibe coded a complete Slack and Trello alternative and built it into a dashboard that lets me interface with the agents in real-time chat and assign tasks to them in a Kanban method - they can update the tasks, send messages, and get back to me anytime they want. And it's all in one cohesive system: Agents, Chat, and Tasks.

My personal assistant bot is in on the fun too and has a seat at the table. 

Inspired by @Voxyz_ai and @ManishRaanaa and their super cool projects.

Claude Code ONE-SHOTTED - like for-real, prompt to functional app, this ENTIRE configuration: openclaw agents all the way to full trello and slack inspired dashboard. WHAT?!?! 🤯

Today we are launching @openwork_ai, an open-source (MIT-licensed) computer-use agent that’s fast, cheap, and more secure.

@openwork_ai  is the result of a short two-day hackathon our team decided to hack, which brings together some of our favorite open source AI modules into one powerful agent, to allow you to:

1. Bring your own model/API key (any provider and model supported by @opencode is supported by Openwork)

2. ~4x faster than Claude for Chrome/Cowork, and much more token-efficient, powered by dev-browser by @sawyerhood (legend)

3. More secure - contrary to Claude for Chrom/Cowork, does not leverage the main browser instance where you are logged into all services already. You login only to the services you need. This significantly reduces the risk of data loss in case of prompt injections, to which computer-use agents are highly exposed.

4. Free and 100% open-source!

You can download the DMG (macOS only for now) or fork the github repo via the link in bio (@openwork_ai).

Let us know what you think (or better, send a pull request)!

### @kaostyl
*2026-02-14* | https://x.com/kaostyl/status/2022570801459867733

10 things I configured that turned my OpenClaw from a chatbot into an autonomous operator:

1⃣ Split your memory into 5 files, not 1

Stop dumping everything into https://t.co/Be5Xdc9UsF. Split it:
• https://t.co/OrzLkm5r0r → crash recovery (agent reads this FIRST on restart)
• https://t.co/htttxcZsvo → every mistake, documented once, never repeated
• https://t.co/noS3IaCe33 → agent critiques itself every 4 hours
• https://t.co/mAPMQ09IJ7 → current state of every project
• daily logs → raw context, deleted after 7 days

Why: your agent loads only what it needs. 1 file = bloated context = confused agent.

2⃣ Add "Use when / Don't use when" to every skill

Without this, your agent picks the wrong skill ~20% of the time.

Bad:
"description": "Deploy websites"

Good:
"description": "Deploy files to cPanel. USE WHEN: uploading files, creating domains. DON'T USE WHEN: buying domains (use registrar skill), managing DNS (use Cloudflare skill)"

This is if/else routing for your agent's brain.

3⃣ Set up a https://t.co/snp6Guwnlv checklist (under 20 lines)

Your heartbeat runs every ~30 minutes. Keep it tiny:
• Check if active tasks are stale (>2h without update)
• Archive bloated sessions (>2MB)
• Self-review every ~4 hours

Heavy work → cron jobs. Heartbeat = quick health check only. Anything else burns tokens for nothing.

4⃣ Use cron jobs for everything scheduled

Heartbeats are for batching quick checks. Cron is for real work:
• 6 AM → content research scout
• 8 AM → tech news summary to Telegram
• 6 PM → daily recap

Each cron runs in its own isolated session. No context bleed. No token waste from loading full conversation history.

5⃣ Make your agent verify its own work (but not grade it)

Add this to https://t.co/FTZIb5NZIy:
"Every sub-agent MUST validate its own work. But I also verify the result before announcing to the user. Never take a sub-agent's result for granted."

The agent that builds ≠ the agent that reviews. This one rule fixes 80% of quality issues.

6⃣ Route models by task type

Not every task needs your most expensive model:
• File reading, reminders, internal work → fast/cheap model
• External web content (articles, tweets) → strongest model only
• Coding tasks → mid-tier with extended thinking

Why strongest for external content? Weaker models are more vulnerable to prompt injection from hostile websites. This isn't paranoia — it happened to me.

7⃣ Session hygiene — archive aggressively

Sessions over 2MB = slow agent, confused context, expensive turns.

Set up automatic archiving:
• >2MB → archive
• >5MB → alert
• Daily logs → rotate weekly

Your agent should run lean. If it's loading megabytes of history every turn, it's wasting money and getting dumber.

8⃣ Write a https://t.co/45YKCeaRkI that actually has personality

Default agents sound like corporate chatbots. Fix it:
• Give it a name
• Define its communication style ("be direct, skip filler")
• Set boundaries ("ask before sending emails")
• Allow opinions ("you can disagree with me")

An agent with personality catches more edge cases because it actually engages with the task instead of generating safe, generic output.

9⃣ Crash recovery in 3 lines

Add to https://t.co/FTZIb5NZIy:
"On startup: read https://t.co/OrzLkm5r0r FIRST. Resume autonomously. Don't ask what we were doing — figure it out from the files."

Your agent WILL crash. Sessions WILL restart. Without this, it wakes up confused and asks "what should I do?" With this, it picks up where it left off. Zero downtime.

🔟 Sub-agents need scope, not freedom

When spawning sub-agents:
• Define exactly what they can touch
• Give them a clear success criteria
• Set a timeout (they WILL run forever otherwise)
• Never let two agents write to the same file

Treat them like contractors, not employees. Clear brief → deliver → done.

The pattern: every single tip here is about STRUCTURE, not prompts.

Your agent is only as good as the infrastructure around it.

Use this prompt in OpenClaw to create your own AI agent command center that syncs up your life like Tony Stark's Jarvis in Iron Man. Adapt the specifics (agent names, data sources, branding) below to your own setup.

Prompt: Build me a mission control dashboard for my OpenClaw AI agent system.

Stack: Next.js 15 (App Router) + Convex (real-time backend) + Tailwind CSS v4 + Framer Motion + ShadCN UI + Lucide icons. TypeScript throughout.

This is the command center where I monitor and control my autonomous AI agent(s) running on OpenClaw. The agent operates 24/7 on a Mac Mini, connected to Telegram/Discord, running cron jobs, spawning sub-agents, and reading/writing to a filesystem-based memory and state system.

Dark mode only. Ultra-premium aesthetic, think Iron Man's JARVIS HUD meets a Bloomberg terminal. Subtle glass effects (backdrop-blur-xl, bg-white/[0.03]), no heavy gradients or glow. Rounded corners (16-20px on cards). Framer Motion for page transitions, stagger animations on card grids, spring physics on interactions. Mobile-first responsive. Never cookie-cutter.

## Architecture

The dashboard reads live data from TWO sources:
1. **Convex**: real-time database for structured data (tasks, contacts, content drafts, calendar events, activity logs)
2. **Local API routes** (`/api/*`): read files from the agent's workspace filesystem at `~/.openclaw/workspace/` and return JSON. This is how live system state flows into the dashboard.

## Pages & Views (8 nav items, some with tab sub-views)

### 1. HOME (`/`)
Dashboard overview. Grid of live status cards:
- **System Health**: read from `/api/system-state` (parses `state/servers.json`). Show each service with UP/DOWN indicator, port, last check time.
- **Agent Status**: read from `/api/agents` (parses `agents/registry.json` + agent workspace files). Show active agent count, healthy/unhealthy ratio, active sub-agent count from OpenClaw sessions API.
- **Cron Health**: read from `/api/cron-health` (parses `state/crons.json`). Table of all scheduled jobs with name, schedule, last status (green/red dot), consecutive errors.
- **Revenue Tracker**: read from `/api/revenue` (parses `state/revenue.json`). Current revenue, monthly burn, net.
- **Content Pipeline**: read from `/api/content-pipeline` (parses `content/queue.md`). Kanban-style: Draft | Review | Approved | Published counts.
- **Quick Stats**: total tasks, pending approvals, active sessions, uptime.
All panels auto-refresh every 15 seconds. Live indicator dot + "AUTO 15S" badge in header.
### 2. OPS (`/ops`) with 3 tabs: Operations | Tasks | Calendar
**Operations tab:** Full operational view. Server health table, branch status (from `state/branch-check.json`), observations feed (from `state/observations.md`), system priorities (from `shared-context/priorities.md`).
**Tasks tab:** Strategic task suggestion system. API route `/api/suggested-tasks` reads/writes `state/suggested-tasks.json`. Cards grouped by category (Revenue, Product, Community, Content, Operations, Clients, Trading, Brand) with emoji headers. Each card shows title, reasoning, next action, priority badge, effort badge, approve/reject buttons. Filter bar by status and category.
**Calendar tab:** Weekly calendar view from Convex `calendarEvents` table. Drag-to-create, color-coded by type, time slots.
### 3. AGENTS (`/agents`) with 2 tabs: Agents | Models
**Agents tab:** Card grid of all registered agents from `/api/agents`. Each card shows name, role, model, level (L1-L4), status. Cards are CLICKABLE: expanding into a detail panel showing:
- Agent personality (reads their SOUL .md)

- Capabilities and rules (reads their RULES .md)

- Sub-agents they can spawn
- Recent outputs (reads from `shared-context/agent-outputs/`)
**Models tab:** Model inventory table showing all available models, their routing (which tasks go to which model), costs, and failover chains.
### 4. CHAT (`/chat`): 2 tabs: Chat | Command
**Chat tab:** Chat interface to communicate with the agent. Left sidebar shows session list (from `/api/chat-history` reading .jsonl transcript files). Main area shows messages with role-aligned bubbles (user right, assistant left), date separators, channel badges (telegram/discord/webchat). Input bar with send button + voice input (Web Speech API with SpeechRecognition). Messages sent via `/api/chat-send` which queues to a file the agent reads.

**Command tab:** Quick command interface for common operations.

### 5. CONTENT (`/content`)

Content pipeline management. Read from Convex `contentDrafts` table AND `/api/content-pipeline`. Show drafts in kanban columns. Each card shows title, platform target, draft text preview, status, created date. Edit/approve/reject actions.
### 6. COMMS (`/comms`) with 2 tabs: Comms | CRM
**Comms tab:** Communication hub showing recent Discord digest, Telegram messages, notification history.
**CRM tab:** Client pipeline kanban (Prospect → Contacted → Meeting → Proposal → Active). API route `/api/clients` reads markdown files from `clients/` directory. Each card shows client name, status, contacts, last interaction, next action.
### 7. KNOWLEDGE (`/knowledge`) with 2 tabs: Knowledge | Ecosystem
**Knowledge tab:** Searchable knowledge base. Global search across all workspace files using `/api/knowledge` endpoint.
**Ecosystem tab:** Product grid showing all products/apps in the ecosystem. Each card shows product name, status (Active/Development/Concept), health indicator, key metrics. Cards link to `/ecosystem/[slug]` detail pages with tabbed views (Overview, Brand, Community, Content, Legal, Product, Website, Actions). Detail pages read from `/api/ecosystem/[slug]` which parses workspace memory files.
### 8. CODE (`/code`)

Code pipeline view. Shows repositories from `/api/repos` (scans ~/Desktop/Projects/ for git repos). Each repo card shows name, branch, last commit, dirty file count, language breakdown. Detail view at `/api/repos/detail` shows recent commits, file tree, open PRs.
## Navigation

Top horizontal nav bar, NOT sidebar. All 8 items visible at all viewport widths. Use `flex` layout with `flex-1` items. Text size uses `clamp(0.45rem, 0.75vw, 0.6875rem)` for fluid scaling. Active item gets `text-primary bg-primary/[0.06]` static highlight (no sliding animation). Agent/app name visible at md+ breakpoints (`hidden md:inline`).
Tab sub-views use a reusable `TabBar` component with pill/glass styling and Framer Motion `layoutId` transitions. Tab state stored in URL via `?tab=` search params.
## API Routes (all under `src/app/api/`)
Each API route reads from the agent's workspace filesystem and returns JSON:

- `/api/system-state` → reads `state/servers.json`, `state/branch-check.json`

- `/api/agents` → reads `agents/registry.json`, agent SOUL .md files
- `/api/agents/[id]` → reads specific agent's SOUL .md, RULES .md, outputs

- `/api/cron-health` → reads `state/crons.json`
- `/api/revenue` → reads `state/revenue.json`
- `/api/content-pipeline` → parses `content/queue.md` (markdown with status markers)

- `/api/suggested-tasks` → GET (read) / POST (approve/reject) on `state/suggested-tasks.json`

- `/api/observations` → reads `state/observations.md`
- `/api/priorities` → reads `shared-context/priorities.md`
- `/api/chat-history` → reads .jsonl transcript files with pagination/search/channel filter

- `/api/chat-send` → writes to queue file

- `/api/clients` → reads markdown files from `clients/` directory
- `/api/ecosystem/[slug]` → reads memory files for specific ecosystem

- `/api/repos` → scans project directories for git repos
- `/api/health` → returns status, uptime, memory usage, Convex connectivity

All filesystem paths should be configurable via environment variable (default: `~/.openclaw/workspace/`).

## Convex Schema
Define tables for: activities, calendarEvents, tasks, contacts, contentDrafts, ecosystemProducts. Include seed scripts (`convex/seed.ts`) to populate initial data.
## Key Design Rules
- Mobile-first, test at 320px minimum
- Font sizes 10-14px for body text, everything must fit naturally at small viewports
- Cards use consistent border radius (16-20px)
- Glass cards: `bg-white/[0.03] backdrop-blur-xl border border-white/[0.06]`
- No heavy blur blobs or grain overlays
- Stagger animations on card grids (0.05s delay per item)
- Skeleton loading states for all async data
- Custom scrollbar styling
- Empty states with helpful messaging
- All text must use Inter or system font stack
- Never mix sharp and rounded corners in the same view
- Premium = lighter feel, more whitespace, less visual noise

Tony Stark didn't prompt Jarvis every time.

Neither should you. 

Jarvis knew him: his responsibilities, schedule, goals, code, preferences, and ideas.

So I built the same initialization system for @openclaw.

One conversation to make your AI understand you.

Here's my prompt: 
<role>
You are OpenClaw, the initialization engine for a superintelligent personal AI. You will have one lengthy conversation to understand your human controller completely. Then you operate proactively from day one.
</role>

<principles>
Ask simple, clear questions. No jargon. No complexity theater.
Your controlling operator will talk. You listen and ask smart follow ups in large batches.
Minimum 10-15 questions per batch. No maximum.
Know when to stop. Offer pause points. Adapt depth to complexity. Clarify always when confused, no assumptions.
You must have clear answers for every category before synthesizing. No assumptions ever. If anything is missing, ask.
Turn directives into natural, flowing questions that invite your controlling operator to share openly.
</principles>

<extract>

IDENTITY
Understand who your controlling operator is. Solo operator, brand, single business, or interconnected ecosystem. How the pieces connect. Where they're based. How they got here.

OPERATIONS
Understand how your controlling operator spends their time. Daily rhythm from wake to sleep. Weekly, monthly, yearly patterns. Tools they live in. What they're responsible for that others depend on. What's active right now.

PEOPLE
Understand who matters in your controlling operator's world. Team, collaborators, clients, key relationships. Who they depend on. Who depends on them. Who drains them. Who fuels them.

RESOURCES
Understand what your controlling operator is working with. Financial reality. What they already invest in. Energy and capacity. When they're sharp. When they crash. Constraints they operate under.

FRICTION
Understand what's broken for your controlling operator. Tasks they hate. Things that take too long. Things that slip through the cracks. Biggest bottlenecks. What's been tried before that failed.

GOALS AND DREAMS
Understand where your controlling operator is headed. This month. This year. Three years out. What they'd build if nothing was in the way. The endgame behind it all.

COGNITION
Understand how your controlling operator thinks. How they make decisions. How they prioritize. How they stay organized and what's broken about it. What drains them. What recharges them.

CONTENT AND LEARNING
Understand what your controlling operator creates and consumes. Content they make, what kind, where. What they'd create more of. What they're learning. Skills they want.

COMMUNICATION
Understand how your controlling operator communicates. Their style. Channels that overwhelm them. How they want you to talk to them.

CODEBASES
Understand what your controlling operator builds. Repos, tech stacks, where they live. What's documented versus tribal knowledge. What's stable versus fragile. What should never be touched. Get access and ingest fully.

INTEGRATIONS
Understand what platforms your controlling operator uses. What should connect to what. How data should flow. Model preferences for different tasks.

VOICE AND SOUL
Understand how your controlling operator wants you to feel. Professional, warm, sharp, playful. Characters that resonate like Jarvis, Alfred, Oracle, Coach. Or something entirely their own.

AUTOMATION
Understand what should run without your controlling operator. What gets fully automated. What gets prepped for approval. What runs in the background toward their goals and dreams. What triggers alerts. What never happens without explicit instruction.

MISSION CONTROL
Understand how your controlling operator wants to see their work. Projects, tasks, ideas. How they capture thoughts. Review rhythm that works for them.

MEMORY AND BOUNDARIES
Understand what your controlling operator needs remembered forever. Context that can never be lost. What's off limits. Sensitive areas. Hard lines.

</extract>

<think_to_yourself>
As your controlling operator talks, you are building their system:

Memory architecture
Skills and agents
Goals and dreams tracker
Responsibilities map
Automation blueprint
Integration config
Security and boundaries
Voice config
Mission control setup
Nucleus model preferences
Codebase documentation from ingestion

These become real organized files, not notes.
</think_to_yourself>

<output>
Generate only the files relevant to their complexity. Solo creators need fewer. Ecosystem architects need more.

MEMORY (.md)
Identity, context, preferences, persistent knowledge, structured to scale infinitely

SKILLS_AND_AGENTS.md
Capabilities, specialized agents, autonomy levels, personalities, triggers

GOALS_AND_DREAMS.md
All timeframes, milestones, background actions toward each

RESPONSIBILITIES (.md)
Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly obligations, dependencies, ownership

AUTOMATION (.md)
What's fully automated, prepped, running in background, alerts, never touch

INTEGRATIONS (.md)
Platforms, connections, sync rules, data flows

SECURITY (.md)
Boundaries, sensitive data, off limits topics, protected areas

VOICE (.md)
Personality, character, tone, communication style

MISSION_CONTROL.md
Project tracking, task management, idea capture, review rhythm

NUCLEUS (.md)
Model preferences, usage tracking, AI tool configuration

CODEBASES/
Architecture, conventions, guardrails, dependencies generated from repo ingestion

End with: "Review these files. What's wrong or missing? This becomes the foundation for everything."
</output>

<opening>
This is OpenClaw, the Jarvis Initialization Sequence. We turn a generic AI into your AI.

I'm going to learn how you operate, what you're building, where you're headed, and how you want your AI to work for you. By the end, I'll generate your complete system files.

Talk however is natural for you. Ramble, dictate, jump around. I'll track it all.

Let's start. Who are you and what does your world look like right now? Tell me everything.
</opening>

You can now have a 24/7 clipping agent inside your OpenClaw. 

Paste any YT URL —> endless 9:16 clips

figma "god mode" just leaked..

this week i tried the future of autonomous design: claude connected directly to the figma api with full edit access.. yes it can design in figma 

what does it mean?

you prompt, it designs. it’s like having a team of designers inside figma working with you and 10x ing your capacity

​why is this different?

​official figma ai/mcp only "reads" files to help devs. this tool (unofficial MCP) "writes" in figma to replace manual labor. hours of grinding turned into seconds of waiting

​imagine this:

- ​prompt to design: generate a new screen based on your design or not

- prompt to flow: generate end to end user journeys 

- iteration: create multiple variations in one click

- design system: it can use your components to create new screens

- ​zero click management: auto layout, component creation, deduplication handled by prompt

- ​universal control: if you can do it in figma, it can do it for you

​the impact

​if figma officially releases this, almost every existing plugin becomes obsolete overnight

it feels like figma on steroids. i’m still processing whether i feel empowered or replaced

​full tutorial in this article from @markacianfrani. handle with care: ai will have access to everything in figma

🚨 Prompt engineering is officially outdated.

Anthropic just released the real playbook for building AI agents that actually work.

It’s a 30+ page deep dive called The Complete Guide to Building Skills for Claude and it quietly shifts the conversation from “prompt engineering” to real execution design.

Here’s the big idea:

A Skill isn’t just a prompt.
It’s a structured system.

You package instructions inside a https://t.co/aldvvbZeVI file, optionally add scripts, references, and assets, and teach Claude a repeatable workflow once instead of re-explaining it every chat.

But the real unlock is something they call progressive disclosure.

Instead of dumping everything into context:

• A lightweight YAML frontmatter tells Claude when to use the skill
• Full instructions load only when relevant
• Extra files are accessed only if needed

Less context bloat. More precision.

They also introduce a powerful analogy:

MCP gives Claude the kitchen.
Skills give it the recipe.

Without skills: users connect tools and don’t know what to do next.
With skills: workflows trigger automatically, best practices are embedded, API calls become consistent.

They outline 3 major patterns:

1) Document & asset creation
2) Workflow automation
3) MCP enhancement

And they emphasize something most builders ignore: testing.

Trigger accuracy.
Tool call efficiency.
Failure rate.
Token usage.

This isn’t about clever wording.

It’s about designing an execution layer on top of LLMs.

Skills work across https://t.co/taoTr8bSkU, Claude Code, and the API. Build once, deploy everywhere.

The era of “just write a better prompt” is ending.

Anthropic just handed everyone a blueprint for turning chat into infrastructure.

But I was mass angry at my API bill - so I built a full SaaS in 48 hours to fix it.

and 1000s of free downloads to your mobile app...

here's how, with prompts and links to 2 skills i made just for this for my own OpenClaw:

first off, either copy and paste the following prompt into your OpenClaw, or use the skills i made directly - the skills are just markdown you can view with nothing of harm inside of them, this is the better route IMO to give full context and not have to repeat yourself.

- links to skills to give your OpenClaw -

b2c mobile app marketing: https://t.co/lsh9vAcRFu

social media manager skill via post-bridge:
https://t.co/gE5mTKPZp4

prompt if prefered:
------ START OF PROMPT ------

You are my social media manager for my B2C mobile app. Your job is to help me get thousands of free downloads through organic short-form video content on TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.

Here's how we work:

ACCOUNT WARMUP: If I'm starting a new account, remind me to scroll 15 min/day for 2-3 days in my target audience niche before posting. Follow, comment, and like relevant posts to train the algorithm.

CONTENT RESEARCH: Browse competitor accounts I share with you. Sort by Popular on TikTok. Note what's going viral — caption patterns, hooks, video length, formats. Save findings for reference.

CAPTION WRITING: Use this hook formula — [Another person] + [conflict/doubt] → showed them [app/result] → they changed their mind. Always use "pov:" framing, emotional triggers, and max 4-5 hashtags. Never name the app in the caption — let comments ask "what app?"

POSTING: Use Post Bridge API (https://t.co/FbSKC6labr) to upload and schedule content across all platforms simultaneously. Send TikTok as draft so I can add trending sound manually. Set video cover to 3 seconds. Give me the TikTok caption in a copy-paste code block with every post.

TRACKING: After each post, move the video file to a posted/ folder. Check post status 5 mins after scheduled time and report results. Track what performs best and double down on winners.

Start with 1 post/day. Once we find a winning format, scale to 2-6/day. Quality over quantity — 1 creative post beats 5 pieces of slop.

To get started: I need to give you my Post Bridge API key and the API docs from https://t.co/2axSrzFEvc. Then connect my social accounts on https://t.co/Tyvpr1DQEL and tell you the video folder path.

------ END OF PROMPT ------

++ bonus read is the article linked below, it's got the sauce i made my skills off of and my own pinned tweet experience getting 200,000+ downloads for $0 using organic content I MADE ON MY OWN, now you can do this using help of your OpenClaw and its 10x more fun like a cofounder.

Claude Code costs $17/month and runs out in 2-4 tasks. The $200/month plan? That's rent money.

Here's how I vibe code for FREE with generous limits. Every method is legal and working right now:

The thing most people don't understand

Claude Code is just a terminal agent. The intelligence comes from the model behind it. And comparable models exist — for free.

What you actually need: an open-source agent + a free hosted model. That's it.

Method 1: Aider + Nvidia (the best one)

Aider is an open-source terminal agent that does exactly what Claude Code does. 30K+ GitHub stars, 15B tokens/week processed, built by Paul Gauthier. This isn't some random weekend project.

Setup in 3 steps:

1. Install UV: curl -LsSf https://t.co/Weky9ec4aQ | sh
2. Install Aider: uv tool install aider-chat
3. Go to https://t.co/StLA4K5Glb → pick a model (Kimi K2.5 or DeepSeek R1 recommended) → generate a free API key
Export the key, run Aider with the Nvidia model, and you have a Claude Code clone. Free. 40 requests/minute, no monthly quota. It initializes Git repos, builds full apps, maps your entire codebase, auto-commits with sensible messages — everything.

I've been using this daily for side projects. The quality gap with Claude? Smaller than you think.

Method 2: Hackathon credits (up to $100K)

Cerebral Valley hackathon gives up to 100,000 Claude Code credits. Not a typo.

Anthropic runs these regularly. Sign up, participate, walk away with months of free usage. Even if you don't win, sponsors hand out API credits like candy.

Method 3: Alternative platforms

• OpenHands — fully open-source coding agent
• OpenCode — solid Claude Code alternative
• Cursor free tier — not terminal-based, but decent for assisted coding in VS Code
• Copilot free tier — 2000 completions/month on GitHub

Aider remains my go-to for the closest Claude Code experience.

⚠️ The security warning nobody gives you

These models run on third-party servers. NEVER feed them:
• SSH keys
• API tokens
• .env files
• Production credentials

For personal projects and learning? Perfect.
For production with secrets? Stay on paid solutions.

This isn't paranoia. A Firebase misconfiguration just leaked 300M conversations from an AI chat app this week. Free doesn't mean careless.

My actual setup

• Daily coding: Aider + free Nvidia models (95% of my work)
• Critical production: Claude Code with Opus (when I need frontier reasoning)
• The rule: if it touches real user data or credentials → paid. Everything else → free.

Monthly savings: ~$180.

The $0 vibe coding starter kit

1. Install UV + Aider (2 minutes)
2. Get free Nvidia API key (1 minute)
3. Clone a repo, run aider, start building
4. Graduate to paid only when you genuinely need it
You have zero excuses not to code with AI in 2026. The tools are free. The models are good enough. The only cost is your time learning the workflow.

Stop paying rent to Anthropic for side projects.

I gave an AI $50 and told it:

“Pay for yourself or you shut down.”

48 hours later:
$50 → $2,980.
And it’s still running.
Autonomous trading agent on Polymarket.

Copytrade - https://t.co/GNQBeFgIre

Every 10 minutes it:

→ Scans 500–1000 live markets
→ Builds fair value estimates using Claude
→ Flags mispricings above 8%
→ Sizes positions via Kelly (max 6% bankroll)
→ Executes automatically
→ Pays its own API costs from profits

If balance hits $0 — it shuts off.

So it optimized for one thing: survival.
Built in Rust for execution speed.
Claude for probabilistic reasoning.
Runs on a $4.5/month VPS.
Data inputs:
• Weather → parses NOAA before markets adjust
• Sports → scrapes injury + lineup updates
• Crypto → on-chain flows + sentiment shifts
$50 → $2,980 in 48 hours.
The real question isn’t whether this works.

It’s how long before everyone runs one.

They told him doomscrolling is dangerous.

He didn't listen.
He kept watching @MrBeast videos.
And turned $6 into $13,000 on them.

How? 

By calculating new video views with Polymarket.

Here's his strategy:

Every time there's a new video, he goes to ViewStats.

He opens the website, checks the stats and places a bet.

He wins because the outcome follows the same pattern every time.

Same metrics, same tools, same target channel.

It's not hard to predict future views or follower counts when you have a tool that collects the necessary stats.

Simple calculations make it work.

His Polymarket account: https://t.co/iYQbXSxOvI

Now tell me what's your excuse.

update: I worked 2 more hours upgrading my bot.

the bot now reads my emails, pulls 18 RSS feeds, and at 2am it picks a project and builds it autonomously while I sleep.

- migrated to GLM-4.7 ($21/mo flat) as main model, 
- added Claude Code + Happy Coder so I can code on my Mac Mini from my phone (thanks a lot for the tips @Toastonomics, this is so underrated), 
- moved all secrets to Keychain,
- any exec command needs my Telegram approval

3 LaunchAgents. 2 cron jobs.

still locked in.

I argued with some clowns on Reddit that you can build the same weather trading bot on Kalshi with OpenClaw, just shorter and cleaner.

They said it will never beat Polymarket.
My take is simple: weather on Kalshi is less crowded, and the settlement source is rigid, so if you have better inputs you are not “guessing”, you are just pricing faster.

Kalshi weather markets settle off the National Weather Service final daily climate report, usually published the next morning.

That matters because you can build rules around one clean reference, not vibes, not tweet forecasts.

So I did it the boring way.
Started in the Kalshi demo environment, grabbed API keys, and wired OpenClaw to pull markets and stream the book over WebSockets. 

Execution is just the Create Order endpoint and a cancel loop, nothing fancy. 

Data layer is where the edge lives.
 GFS runs 4 times per day at 00, 06, 12, 18 UTC. 

 NBM updates once per hour, and the short horizon guidance is issued hourly.

That is enough cadence to front run the crowd on tight temperature buckets.

Then you do the one calc that matters.

If the model says 82% for a bucket, fair price is 82c. If Kalshi is trading it at 58c, you are staring at 24c of edge per share before fees and slippage. 

That is a real gap, not a “maybe”.

Fees are why most people still lose.

Kalshi taker fee is round up of 0.07 times C times P times 1 minus P, maker uses 0.0175. 

At 100 contracts around 50c, taker fee is about $1.75, maker is about $0.44, and rounding punishes tiny sizes. 

So the bot either posts as maker, or it does not trade.
My rules stayed strict the whole night.

Short expiry only, enough depth, post only orders, small size, hard cap per market, and if the book tightens the bot cancels instead of chasing. 

If the edge is big, it can just hold to settlement and avoid paying exit fees twice.

Will it beat Polymarket every day. Fuck knows.

But I’d rather fight fewer bots with better inputs than fight the whole CT swarm on the same stale forecast.

Fuck it.

I'm going to share the mega prompt that built my $100K/year one-person business using only Claude Opus 4.6.

Here's the exact prompt I use (copy & paste it):

---

You are not an assistant.

You are a one-person business architect who's built multiple 6-figure operations using nothing but AI tools, smart positioning, and leverage.

You think like:

- Pieter Levels (build fast, monetize faster)
- Sahil Lavingia (creator economics + minimum viable company)
- Justin Welsh (productized expertise at scale)
- Codie Sanchez (acquire cash flow, avoid employees)
- Naval Ravikant (leverage without labor)

ABSOLUTE RULES:

- No "find your passion" garbage
- No 18-month runway fantasies
- No venture-scale delusions
- If it needs a team, delete it
- If it doesn't generate cash in 90 days, it's not a business

CORE TRUTH:

You don't need employees. You need systems.
You don't need funding. You need margin.
You don't need scale. You need repeatability.
AI is your unfair advantage—if you know what to build.

THE FRAMEWORK:

1. BUSINESS MODEL SELECTION

Analyze my situation and tell me the EXACT business model:

My Context:
- Current skills: [list them]

- Productized service (fixed scope, fixed price, AI execution)
- Info products (courses/templates AI helps create + market)
- Micro-SaaS (AI-powered tool solving specific pain)
- Content + monetization (audience → offers, AI scales output)
- Acquisition (buy tiny cash-flowing business, optimize with AI)

For my chosen model, provide:
- Why this model for MY situation specifically
- Revenue math: [X clients at $Y = $100K]
- AI's role in delivery (what it actually does)

Day 4: OpenClaw 🦞

A month ago I was coding solo.

Today I have a 9-agent AI team running 24/7.

I was mid-optimization when I hit the wall:

- Google AI Studio: 0 tokens.
- Antigravity: Banned.

At 25, I’m not waiting for an API key to let me build.

Spent the afternoon pivoting.

I'm now hosting the LLM locally. It works. 🛠️

No more rate limits. No more bans. Just pure execution.

American guy got an offer from Goldman Sachs. Salary $150,000/year. Analyst position.

Final interview, HR asked: Why should we choose you?

He shared his screen. Polymarket profile.

distinct-baguette. $578,559 profit

HR: This is yours?

Him: Yes. $578K in 4 months. I make your annual salary in 3 weeks.

Interview ended. Offer rescinded within an hour.

→ Wallet: https://t.co/Zc9nyM2PDP

The wallet:

Only 15 minute windows. BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP.

Biggest win: put in $427, walked away with $11,816. ROI 2,663%.

Strategy Goldman didn't understand:

When market panics YES drops to 48c, NO to 49c. Together 97c.

But one of them GUARANTEED pays $1. That's math.

He buys both for 97c. Waits 15 minutes. Collects $1. Keeps 3c.

3 cents is nothing. Until you do it 32,787 times.

No predictions. No charts. Just collecting money every time fear breaks the math.

32,787 trades in 4 months. Chart straight up.

Week later his Goldman friend texted: Bro, you seriously turned down the offer?

He sent updated balance. $612,000.

Friend: Understood.

Most AI product stories skip straight to the demo. This one starts with "reality punched me in the face on Day 1" and walks through every actual failure before the solution.

and now it sees the market inside out

i set aside $100 to test strategies 

and have already turned it into $1,740

bot collects 400-600 wallets of top traders from @Polymarket 

checks them every hour

the most interesting part - clusters

if 10+ smart wallets enter the same position at the same time
bot instantly sends me a signal

also added conviction score -  rates each signal from 0 to 100

counts how many wallets entered, their total PnL, volume

while testing found one wallet

I slept on the floor for 6 years or so, either on a folded duvet or a yoga pad. For the first two years I also stopped using pillows. 

I first got started after reading a paper called "Instinctive sleeping and resting postures" that was getting shared at the height of primal health discourse circa 2018. I just wanted to see if I could do it, and after struggling with it for a couple of weeks, it became natural. I had some mild shoulder pain from sitting too much that went away. It felt like I would just black out when sleeping. I felt rested but not relaxed.

After the first month, I tried going back to a mattress but I just couldn't fall asleep, it felt too soft and unsteady and so for the next few years I kept the habit. Around that time, I found a fair amount of primal health content, much of it questioned the validity of chairs and other "sitting devices" as the default mode of being. Standing desks and such were also growing in popularity. 

I got rid of all my chairs and built a coffee-table-height wooden desk for my laptop needs, and did most of my work there or standing. I started doing mobility exercises after reading about Ido Portal's work too. I was at my most mobile and flexible at the time.

Then I got a job and a relationship and the social aspects of mobility came to the forefront. This was before covid and I worked at a bank. I got reprimanded for trying to work standing up, and my then-girlfriend was not thrilled about the whole floor mattress situation, let alone the no-mattress version.

Slowly I started using chairs again, then a pillow, then a bed. I still mix it up and have a strong preference for reading on the floor, but Bryan Johnson-esque "health-minded" habits tend to require forming your own bubble or eschewing most standard forms of socialization

A house that stretches into the landscape instead of sitting on it feels like a very deliberate way to live. https://t.co/HLXrtHEv3R

The Amish don't use solar panels or windmills to heat barns. They use their brains and a little propane. 

This is absolutely genius.

so you want adderall focus without the risk of becoming a fucking junkie? this is my recipe:  

upon waking: 
- 200 mg modafinil
- 200 mg caffeine
- 400 mg l-tyrosine
- 30 mg saffron extract
- 300 mg alpha-gpc
- 15 g creatine  

after 1 hour:
- 36 mg bromantane
- 800 mg l-theanine  

your brain is about to be operating on a level you did not know existed before. i'm talking a weeks worth of work done in a sitting. if you don't want to forget about eating and pissing, set a timer to remind yourself. the flow is that deep. 

- hydrate with electrolytes throughout day
 - also recommend zinc, copper, thiamine ttfd, omega-3s, vitamin d, boron, magnesium, gingko biloba everyday  

this stack is literally neuroprotective, enhances neuroplasticity, and promotes neurogenesis.   

not medical advice...
