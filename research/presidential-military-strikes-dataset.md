- Thursday + Friday: 28.6% (2/7)

## DATA GAPS — NEED INPUT

1. **Current Iran strikes (Feb 2026)** — exact dates
2. **June 2025 "12 Day War"** — did US conduct kinetic strikes or just Israeli ops with US support?
3. **Obama drone campaign granularity** — thousands of strikes; need to focus on major escalations
4. **Bush-era Iraq/Afghanistan** — many operations; need major escalation points
