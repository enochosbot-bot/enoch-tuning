## The Problem
- Client info buried across disconnected systems
- **Redtail** (CRM) not synced with **eMoney** (financial planning) not synced with **Orion** (reporting)
- Microsoft 365 / Outlook emails NOT synced with Redtail despite having the integration tool enabled
- Team works out of spreadsheets = yet another unsynced data silo
- Everything manual, nothing flows between systems

## Systems
- CRM: Redtail
- Financial Planning: eMoney
- Reporting/Portfolio: Orion
- Email: Microsoft 365 / Outlook
- Spreadsheets: likely Excel/Google Sheets

## Next Steps
- Build presentation for the office: what OpenClaw / AI agents can do for the firm
- Find enterprise-ready agent platform (security + support) — Deacon thinks there's one in his X bookmarks (DO NOT FORGET)
- Quick wins: enable the Redtail-Outlook sync that's already available but not working
- Bigger vision: unified client data layer across Redtail ↔ eMoney ↔ Orion

## Notes
- Deacon is new, no bio page yet, working on ops
- 9-person firm in Plano TX
- RIA — compliance/security matters for any AI tooling
