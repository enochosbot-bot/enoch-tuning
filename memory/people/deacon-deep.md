# Deacon — Deep Profile (Initialization Conversation, 2026-02-16 ~1:30 AM)

## 5-Year Vision
- Kids on the way or already started (Ellisyn is 23)
- Growing in faith, deeply rooted in Reformation Church community
- Pillar in local community — very involved in local politics, possibly running for a seat
- Continue as financial advisor but wants more flexibility/mobility than traditional advisor life
- House in North Texas
- Producing studio for faith/politics content is a real aspiration
- Sees AI as the unlock for translating his strategic thinking into actual products

## Core Wiring
- Systems thinker stuck in an execution role
- The advisor job uses ~30% of his brain (people skills)
- The other 70% — strategic architecture, building systems — had no outlet until AI/OpenClaw
- First technology that's matched his actual wiring
- Late nights aren't insomnia — it's flow state

## What Drains Him
- Filling out forms and operational grunt work at Spectrum
- Can't use AI at work yet — this is a major driver to get the presentation done
- The gap between what he knows is possible and what he's stuck doing daily

## What He's Avoiding
- CFP studying — sidetracked by this project. This is the most dangerous avoidance. The credential is his ticket to flexibility.
- Committing to a strict exercise routine
- Regular sleep schedule (night owl by nature, worse when in flow)

## Providence
- Believes God's hand brought him to that political event where Jon pushed him toward this technology
- Sees this as calling taking shape, not a hobby or phase
- Faith is the lens through which all decisions filter

## Key Insight
- He needs the CFP to unlock the flexibility he actually wants
- The Spectrum AI pitch is the bridge from "forms drone" to "advisor with an AI team"
- The producing studio vision is real but needs the foundation (CFP, financial stability, house) first
