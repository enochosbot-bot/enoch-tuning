### Deacon Personal Details Learned
- Plays **euphonium** with Stonebriar's classical music program
- **Current church:** Reformation Church, Allen TX (Reformed, expository, est. 2022)

- Met Ellisyn **dancing at Red River** (honky tonk bar) — West Coast Swing
- Loves **Civ games**, **pool/billiards**, **chess**
- **Christian apologetics is the dream** — wants to create content in this space
- Buddies create apologetics content, share raw videos in GroupMe — potential shorts pipeline

### Content Pipeline Built
- Full video-to-shorts pipeline at `scripts/content-pipeline/`
- Scripts: pipeline.sh, transcribe.sh, find-clips.py, cut-clips.sh, add-captions.sh, format-vertical.sh, batch.sh
- Clip finder tuned for apologetics moments (conviction, scripture, emotional breakthroughs)
- Transcription via OpenAI Whisper API, vertical formatting via ffmpeg

### RPG Dashboard — Multiple Iterations
- v1-v3: CSS-based, Deacon wasn't satisfied ("we can do better")
- v4: Skyrim-inspired with reference images (Dragonsreach, Palace of Kings, homestead, overhead guards)
- v5: Full canvas pixel art — SNES-style, drawn pixel-by-pixel
- Still iterating — Deacon wants higher quality

### Matt Berman OpenClaw Video Analyzed
- Saved to `research/openclaw-power-setup-youtube_2026-02-15.md`
- Key techniques: CRM ingestion, video idea pipeline, agent council, cost-optimized X search chain, humanizer, meeting transcript → action items

### GroupMe Integration Explored
- GroupMe has bot API with webhook callbacks
- Needs public URL (Tailscale or ngrok) for callback
- Would enable daily digests of private political group chat
- Parked until Tailscale is active

### X OAuth Still Blocked
- X's authorize page hangs on logo in both Brave and Safari
- Tried generating user Access Token from developer portal instead
- Deacon sent new bearer token (app-level) — still need user-level Access Token + Secret
- In progress

### Brave Browser Incident
- Spawned OpenClaw debug browser instance that conflicted with main Brave
- Caused "untitled" tabs / Gmail not loading
- Fixed by killing debug instance and restarting Brave
- Lesson: don't spawn debug browser instances

## Still Pending
- X user-level Access Token + Secret (in progress)
- Mac reboot → Tailscale → voice calls + GroupMe webhook
- Dashboard pixel art iteration (v5 delivered, may need more polish)
- Allies presentation doc
- Spectrum AI presentation
- BotFather profile pic (manual)
- Humanizer skill retry
- Nick Fuentes content scan
- Google Takeout parts 2 & 3 (timed out downloading — may have more data)

## Evening Session — Agent Architecture & Cleanup

### Ezra the Scribe 📜 — Finalized
- Name chosen: "Ezra the Scribe" (not Scribe, not Caleb)
- Config ID: `scribe` in agents.list
- Workspace: `~/.openclaw/workspace-scribe/`
- Model: Sonnet (anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
- Role: spawnable sub-agent for research/writing/dossiers — NOT bound to any topic
- Decision: no topic binding — Enoch dispatches Ezra on demand. Research tab stays as URL ingest only.
- Rationale: Ezra's value is his brain, not his location. Binding to Research would lose him everywhere else.
- `sessions_spawn` with `agentId: scribe` returns forbidden — must use default agent + model override for now

### Arnold ⚔️ — Upgraded
- Security topic (3) system prompt rewritten: medieval knight-commander personality
- Siege metaphors, dry humor, signs with ⚔️
- "The walls hold, my lord" / "The eastern gate is breached"

### Cron Jobs → Codex (Free)
- All 6 recurring cron jobs migrated from Opus to `openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex`
- Email sorter, git backup, Arnold daily scan, workspace self-check, X bookmarks, Arnold weekly audit
- Codex connection tested and verified (3s response)

### Jace vs Monty Montañez — TX-32
- Quick comparison built for Deacon
- Monty Montañez: combat veteran, small business owner, Garland TX, grassroots campaign
- No Trump endorsement, minimal FEC money, not polling
- Jace remains clear frontrunner (Trump endorsement Feb 4)

### Cancelled / Removed
- iMessage channel — cancelled ("we are not doing that")
- Scribe binding to group — removed (would override Enoch on all topics)

### Humanizer Skill
- Working! Tested with AI slop text, scored 65/100, caught 16 issues
- Building custom Deacon voice profile via Ezra (spawned on Sonnet)

### Deacon Voice Profile (In Progress)
- Pulled real emails from before Feb 14 to calibrate
- Key patterns: ultra-short, no fluff, dashes over formal punctuation, warm but direct
- Tone shifts: fragments in chat → brief+warm to family → "Hi [Name]," + body + "Warm Regards" at work
- Ezra spawned to build full profile at workspace-scribe/writing/deacon-voice-profile.md

### Zach Rodgers
- PDF guide sent to Deacon via Telegram (already built, was waiting on email)
- Email still pending

### People — New
- **Dylan** (Dylanmiller411@yahoo.com) — received Jace dossier
- **Noah** (Noahjcoffee@gmail.com) — received Jace dossier
- **Lmm362@gmail.com** — received Jace dossier
