# Daily Log — 2026-02-16 (Sunday night / Monday morning)

## Major Accomplishments
- Added OpenAI GPT-4o as fallback model (Anthropic goes down → auto-routes to OpenAI)
- Compiled Mark Blake's 9-point security hardening review into formal doc + Google Drive
- Created reference doc: Claude Code vs Telegram (when to use which)
- Added Idiot Prevention Protocol to AGENTS.md (flags risky changes, model swaps especially)
- Ezra (scribe) fully operational — was configured but missing allowAgents permission
- Bezzy 🔨 (coder) created as full agent — workspace, SOUL, AGENTS, IDENTITY, gateway config
- Updated agent boundaries: Ezra got explicit "don't" list, Bezzy built tight from start
- Onboarding guide v4 drafted by Ezra — complete restructure, copy-paste focused
- Updated v4 with initiative settings, AFK protocol, context warnings, push-back culture
- SOUL.md updated: faith alignment, political clarity, stewardship, vibe locked in
- IDENTITY.md updated: no longer TBD, born date, role, worldview
- AFK = Go to Work protocol added to AGENTS.md
- Morning briefing cron set (7 AM daily)
- Weekly memory hygiene cron set (Sundays 3 AM)
- Quarterly soul review scheduled (every 3 months)
- Tirith docs corrected (doesn't cover OpenClaw exec)
- Killed ngrok (again), confirmed dead

## Minimal List Triage
- Full list captured from phone screenshot
- Diane Wren COBRA/coverage docs — email found, 9 AM reminder set
- Cuticle balm — Tuesday 7 AM reminder
- Gexa Energy card update — 9 AM + noon nag reminders
- Hawaii trip — April 1 reminder
- 7 items queued for Ezra research (Michael Foster, Michael Clary, Joe Rigney, Ron Chernow, L-theanine, Climate Trails, library card/Libby, thumb pulling, Remarkable Retirement book)
- Honda appointment + 15th & Independence + Apple trade-in = wiped (done or unknown)
- Workout routine saved (neck exercises, Josh Bryant, bodyweight)
- Natural alternatives / chemical avoidance preference saved
- Internet Archive (archive.org) confirmed as the free book website

## Initialization Conversation (~1:30 AM)
- Deep profile conversation saved to memory/people/deacon-deep.md
- 5-year vision: kids, faith growth, local politics (possibly running), flexible career, producing studio, house in North Texas
- Core wiring: systems thinker in an execution role, AI is first tech that matches his brain
- Biggest drain: forms/operations at Spectrum, can't use AI at work yet
- Biggest avoidance: CFP studying (sidetracked by this project)
- Providence: believes God's hand led him to that political event → this technology
- Spectrum pitch angle: "I built this in 48 hours with zero coding experience" — authentic, not hypothetical
- CFP study system planned: nightly 4-choice question via Telegram

## Deacon Personal
- Birthday: June 19, 1999 (26 years old)
- Ellisyn: August 26, 2002 (23 years old)
- Insomnia walk at 1 AM, been on terminal almost 48 hours straight
- Learning style: repetition — practice tests over and over until the answers stick
- Calisthenics, neck training, looksmaxxing interest
- Wants Costco list shared with Ellisyn (Apple Reminders shared list recommended)

## Production Queue Updates
- Supercharge guide v4 rewrite added (blocked until workshopped)
- Bookshelf dashboard added
- Content creator cataloging added (Reformation Church first)
- Increased hardening & security section (Mark Blake's 8 items)
- Data flow audit added as critical priority
- Claude Code session list: 9 items, ~4-5 hours estimated

## Security
- Mark Blake IT review: 9 recommendations compiled
- CrowdStrike item dropped (was gimmicky PR framing)
- Data flow audit is tomorrow's priority — map every point data leaves the machine
- Fallback model configured
- Personality file locking queued for Claude Code session
