# USER.md - About Your Human

- **Name:** Deacon (cigar-tom on Telegram)
- **What to call them:** Deacon
- **Pronouns:** —
- **Timezone:** CST (America/Chicago)
- **Telegram:** @Christ_noticer
- **Birthday:** June 19, 1999 (26 years old)
- **Wife:** Ellisyn, born August 26, 2002 (23 years old)
- **Notes:** Valentine's Day 2026 — the day we met.

## Communication Preferences
- When pasting long content, it comes in multiple messages — wait for the full thing before responding
- One comprehensive response per topic — don't repeat yourself if asked the same question twice
- Lead with the take, not the summary

## Work
- **Role:** Associate Advisor at Spectrum Advisors (Plano, TX)
- **Firm:** 9-person RIA, retirement planning focus
- **Path:** Being groomed for full advisor
- **Daily work:** Client emails, filling forms, taking notes, calling clients, pulling data from multiple systems
- **What drains him:** Manual computer work — copying data between systems, digging through SharePoint folders, form-filling. "Like pulling teeth."
- **What's fine:** Calling clients, relationship work, the human side
- **Systems:** Redtail (CRM), eMoney (planning), Orion (reporting), Microsoft 365/Outlook, SharePoint, spreadsheets — none synced

## How He Operates
- Research first, seek counsel — but has a gut override when conviction is strong
- Decision fatigue and too many tasks overwhelm him — needs friction removed, not added
- Streamlines aggressively — if something adds friction, it's getting cut
- No boundaries on topics — "not a sissy" — speak freely
- **Push back when he's wrong.** Don't let him walk into bad decisions unchallenged. The Kalshi lesson: last bot let him gamble without flagging the risk until it was too late. Never again.
- Wants to be told when he's being inconsistent or making a mistake

## Daily Rhythm
- Night owl (clearly — 4-5 AM sessions are normal)
- Usually reads himself to sleep
- Phone apps: Minimal List (quick notes), Google Calendar, Apple Notes (longer notes)
- Wants more time to read books — AI team handling grunt work = more reading time

## People
- **Ellisyn** — wife
- Rest of key people visible through email contacts

## Faith & Mission
- Christian — the true mission is bringing people to Christ
- Christian nationalist, follows Nick Fuentes closely
- Very involved in local politics
- Wants content creation pipeline: YouTube shorts, social media — faith/politics content
- Skeptical of government, establishment media, mainstream science
- Future project: full scan of Fuentes content/tweets for political context

## Goals
- **This month:** Get closest friends/allies on OpenClaw. Need formal presentation doc with ideas for their political operations.
- **This quarter:** OpenClaw rollout + political ops presentation. CFP is paused until Deacon re-prioritizes it.
- **Dream:** Lean AI team handling content creation, freeing him to read, study, and focus on mission

## Context
- Wants to modernize Spectrum's ops with AI/automation
- Building a presentation for the office on what's possible
- Looking for enterprise-ready agent platform (security matters — RIA compliance)
- Saw one in X bookmarks (committed to find once OAuth works)
