Guide for Jason Brownstein — From One Advisor to Another</h2>
<p><em>Written by Deacon Ridley — who built most of this in one night,
which should tell you something.</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-short-version">The Short Version</h2>
<p>There’s a free, open-source AI tool that can: - <strong>Auto-dial
your prospect list and research every business before you call</strong>
- <strong>Pull revenue, employee count, industry, pain points, and news
on any company in seconds</strong> - <strong>Sort your inbox, draft
follow-ups, and schedule meetings while you sleep</strong> -
<strong>Build and maintain a custom CRM that you own — no monthly fees,
no Edward Jones approval needed</strong> - <strong>Scrape the internet
for qualified prospects matching your exact criteria</strong></p>
<p>It’s called <strong>OpenClaw</strong>. It runs on a $500 Mac Mini on
your desk. Your data never leaves your office. And it costs about
$30/month to operate.</p>
<p>I set it up tonight. Here’s what I’ve already done with it.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-i-built-in-one-night">What I Built in One Night</h2>
<p>No exaggeration. I started this evening. Here’s where I am:</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Automated email sorting</strong> — 19 custom labels, sorts
every 2 hours, archives the noise, keeps only action items in my inbox.
I used to spend 45 minutes on this every morning. Now it’s 5 minutes of
review.</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Full presentation for my RIA</strong> — ROI analysis
showing <strong>$39,000-52,000/year in recovered productivity</strong>
for our 9-person firm. The agent helped me research, write, and format
the whole thing.</p>
<p>✅ <strong>X/Twitter bookmark intelligence</strong> — Pulled all 77
of my bookmarks, categorized them by topic, set up daily monitoring for
new saves. It’s like having a research analyst watching my feed.</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Calendar management</strong> — I tell it “schedule brass
band rehearsal March 15, 7 AM, invite my wife” and it creates the event,
tags her, and sets a reminder. Done.</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Enterprise security research</strong> — CrowdStrike (yes,
that CrowdStrike) published a full analysis of this tool because
enterprises are deploying it. That’s the credibility bar we’re talking
about.</p>
<p>This isn’t a chatbot. It’s infrastructure. And you need it more than
I do — because you’re the one making 50 outbound calls a day.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="why-this-is-built-for-you">Why This Is Built For You</h2>
<p>Let’s be honest about your situation:</p>
<p>You’re at Edward Jones. You’re grinding outbound calls to business
owners. Every call requires research — what does this company do, how
big are they, what’s their revenue, do they have a retirement plan,
who’s the decision maker?</p>
<p>Right now you’re probably doing one of two things: 1. Winging it
(bad) 2. Spending 10 minutes Googling before each call (slow)</p>
<p>Here’s what OpenClaw does instead:</p>
<h3 id="before-the-call">Before the Call</h3>
<p>You give it a list of businesses — scraped from the internet, pulled
from a database, or just a zip code and an industry. The agent:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pulls company data</strong>: revenue, employee count,
industry, founding year, key personnel</li>
<li><strong>Checks news</strong>: recent press, expansions, layoffs,
acquisitions — anything you can reference</li>
<li><strong>Finds the decision maker</strong>: owner name, LinkedIn
profile, direct line if available</li>
<li><strong>Scores the prospect</strong>: based on criteria you define
(company size, industry, plan type, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Writes a call brief</strong>: one paragraph with everything
you need to sound like you’ve known them for years</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is sitting on your screen before you pick up the
phone.</p>
<h3 id="during-the-call">During the Call</h3>
<p>You’re talking to a business owner about their 401(k). They mention
they have 47 employees and are growing. While you’re talking, the
agent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pulls comparable plan benchmarks for companies their size</li>
<li>Drafts a follow-up email with your talking points</li>
<li>Adds notes to your CRM in real-time</li>
<li>Schedules the next meeting on your calendar</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="after-the-call">After the Call</h3>
<p>The agent: - Sends the follow-up email you approved - Updates the CRM
with call notes and next steps - Moves the prospect to the next stage in
your pipeline - Queues the next prospect brief for your next call</p>
<p><strong>You never stop calling.</strong> The admin work happens
around you, not instead of you.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-prospecting-machine">The Prospecting Machine</h2>
<p>This is where it gets ridiculous.</p>
<h3 id="data-scraping">Data Scraping</h3>
<p>The agent can scrape the internet for qualified prospects. You define
the criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Industry: manufacturing, medical practices, law firms, whatever</li>
<li>Location: within 50 miles of your office</li>
<li>Size: 20-500 employees (sweet spot for retirement plans)</li>
<li>Signals: hiring, expanding, recently funded, no current advisor
listed</li>
</ul>
<p>It builds your list automatically. Every morning you wake up to fresh
prospects with full research briefs.</p>

<h2 id="custom-crm-why-you-want-one">Custom CRM — Why You Want One</h2>
<p>Edward Jones has their own systems. Cool. When you go independent
(and we both know that’s the plan), you need your own.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem with off-the-shelf CRMs: -
<strong>Salesforce</strong>: $75-150/user/month. Bloated. Designed for
enterprises with 500 salespeople. - <strong>Redtail</strong>: $99/month.
Good for advisors but limited customization. -
<strong>Wealthbox</strong>: $59/month. Nice UI, same limitations.</p>
<p>Here’s what a custom CRM built on OpenClaw looks like:</p>

<li><strong>Prospect Database</strong>: every scraped lead with full
company data, contact info, call history</li>
<li><strong>Client Database</strong>: AUM, plan type, last review date,
household info, notes</li>
<li><strong>Pipeline Tracker</strong>: stage tracking (cold → contacted
→ meeting set → proposal → closed)</li>
<li><strong>Auto-enrichment</strong>: agent continuously updates company
data, news, personnel changes</li>
<li><strong>Smart reminders</strong>: “You haven’t called this prospect
in 14 days” or “This client’s plan is up for renewal”</li>

<p>That’s <strong>two full working days</strong> back. Every week.</p>
<h3 id="revenue-impact">Revenue Impact</h3>
<p>If you’re making 40 calls/day and the agent: - Increases call quality
(you’re prepared, not winging it) - Increases call volume (no admin
between calls) - Automates follow-up (nothing falls through cracks)</p>
<p>Even a <strong>10% improvement in conversion rate</strong> on 200
calls/week is massive. If your average client is worth $3,000/year in
revenue:</p>
<pre><code>200 calls/week × 5% close rate = 10 new clients/week
10% improvement = 11 new clients/week
+1 client/week × $3,000/year = +$156,000/year in new revenue</code></pre>
<p>That’s conservative. The real number is probably higher because
you’re also calling better prospects (the scraping targets qualified
leads, not random businesses).</p>

<h2 id="the-independence-play">The Independence Play</h2>
<p>Here’s the part Edward Jones doesn’t want you thinking about.</p>
<p>When you go independent, you take: - Your client relationships ✅ -
Your CRM data (if it’s yours) ✅ - Your prospect lists ✅ - Your
automated workflows ✅ - Your entire operation ✅</p>
<p>If all of that lives in Edward Jones’ systems, you start from zero.
If it lives on your Mac Mini running OpenClaw, you unplug it, plug it in
at your new office, and you’re operational on day one.</p>
<p><strong>Your AI team doesn’t care who your broker-dealer is.</strong>
It just keeps working.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-get-started">What You Need to Get Started</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>A Mac Mini</strong> (~$500, or use any computer you already
have)</li>
<li><strong>30 minutes</strong> to install OpenClaw (I’ll walk you
through it)</li>
<li><strong>A Claude subscription</strong> ($20/month — this powers the
AI brain)</li>
<li><strong>Your phone</strong> (Telegram app for mobile access to your
agent)</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it. No IT department. No approval process. No vendor contract.
No Edward Jones permission slip.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="how-deacons-firm-is-using-it">How Deacon’s Firm Is Using It</h2>
<p>I’m not just pitching you something I read about. Here’s my actual
setup:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>9-person RIA</strong> — building a presentation showing
<strong>$39,000-52,000/year in recovered productivity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Email auto-sorting</strong> with 19 custom labels, runs
every 2 hours</li>
<li><strong>Calendar automation</strong> — events, reminders, attendee
management via chat</li>
<li><strong>Research pipeline</strong> — the agent monitors my X
bookmarks, saves research, categorizes by topic</li>
<li><strong>Video generation</strong> — AI-generated content for
marketing (yes, really)</li>
<li><strong>Full audit trail</strong> — CrowdStrike-level security
analysis confirms the architecture is enterprise-grade</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft Teams integration</strong> — the whole team will
interact with the agent through Teams, our existing tool</li>
</ul>
<p>I built the framework in one night. The presentation alone could
justify the tool — it would have taken me a full day to research and
write what the agent produced in 20 minutes.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Call me.</strong> I’ll walk you through what I built and
answer questions.</li>
<li><strong>Pick up a Mac Mini</strong> (or use what you have — any Mac,
Linux box, or even a Raspberry Pi works).</li>
<li><strong>Block 30 minutes.</strong> I’ll remote in and help you
install it.</li>
<li><strong>Start with email + prospect research.</strong> You’ll feel
the difference in 24 hours.</li>
</ol>
<p>The tools exist. The cost is negligible. The only question is whether
you want to keep grinding manually or let the machine handle the grunt
work while you focus on what you’re actually good at — closing.</p>
<p>Your move, Jason.</p>
